WEBVTT

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.700
I would like to thank you all for attending

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.759
the first Tech Edge that ETail is sponsoring.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.519
This is gonna become a monthly webinar series

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.420
to help you guys grow your business.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.960
I hope you're seeing that we're trying to make this

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.640
a new ETail with higher engagement,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.079
more focus on what's gonna help you

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.780
run your business better, grow your business,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.000
and hopefully grow it more profitably.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.420
It will be, we're gonna cover this at the end,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.100
but it is gonna be every month,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.179
the second Wednesday of the month.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.539
And we'll be talking about new features, new modules.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.000
Very possibly we'll be talking about topics

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.420
that you ask us to talk about.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.299
So mark it on your calendars now.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.739
1 p.m. East Coast, noon central,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.120
and 10 a.m. West Coast time,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.480
and 11 a.m. for the mountain people

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.480
will be the monthly ETail e-commerce Tech Edge

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.120
hosted by me, Jeff Burkhardt.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.200
And every month I will have a new

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.640
or the appropriate subject matter expert with me.

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.459
And with that, we're off.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.829
One thing I think that we need to talk about more internally,

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.790
although we bring this up at every company meeting,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.590
which we hold monthly,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.930
is there's only one reason why we're really here.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.909
And it is to help you guys grow

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.189
and really focus on making sure that you grow profitably.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.269
That is the only use for our platform

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.629
is to help you drive your business.

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:05.010
And we're gonna find ways to enable you

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.769
to do that more efficiently,

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:09.889
find ways for you to do that,

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.330
not necessarily asking us to do everything for you,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.250
but educating you and helping you use the system better.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.729
So with that in mind,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.490
I am your host.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.490
And with me today is one of the many, many, many Davises

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.110
that we have in the organization, James.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.830
James was gonna actually wanted to get a question

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.830
on the poll, which we'll be showing at the end of the,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.150
at the end of the session,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.710
there will be a survey for you to fill out.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.150
And one of the questions is,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.030
is James better in a comb-over or a better ball?

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.969
So you have your two options on the screen

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.849
to take a look at right now,

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.289
please vote at the end in the survey at the end.

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.969
Today, we're gonna be talking about catalog source.

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.969
How this tool effectively and efficiently

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.229
helps you get new data sources into ETL

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.449
in a safe, automated way very quickly.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.530
Future sessions, the sky's the limit.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.310
What do you wanna learn about?

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.110
We have a full laundry list of things

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.409
that we wanna talk about

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.770
on the second Wednesday of every month,

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.909
but we've polled our internal team.

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.490
Is it pricing?

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.490
Is it taking the next layer down in catalog source?

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.370
Or is there a topic that you want us to talk about

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.289
and we're gonna listen.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.189
We're gonna get much better at listening.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.550
God gave us two ears and one mouth for a very good reason.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.370
So once again, thank you for coming.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.909
And now James, can you talk about the agenda

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.349
just for a minute or two?

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.129
Yeah, so we did a little intro

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.909
to the webinar series in the house, me and Joe.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.629
The next slide, I'm gonna spend some time

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.430
talking about what is a catalog source

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.889
and why you should care,

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.170
give you some example usages.

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:27.829
After that, we're going to go through a basic use case

00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:30.889
and set up of a catalog source to import quantity.

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:35.850
Then we will look at various applications

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.689
of the catalog source,

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.050
where it can be utilized,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.009
what it's used for in various business scenarios,

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.490
have some time for Q and A

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.310
and then set some goals for the next Tech Edge

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.750
and do a poll on the next topics

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.129
and wrap it up from there.

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.389
One thing I wanna add is we're gonna make this video

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.310
available to everyone as a digital asset.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.709
You'll be getting a link to it

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:09.269
so that you can either rewatch it yourself

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:13.509
or share with other teammates that maybe couldn't make today.

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.470
We are aware that the second Wednesday of March

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.889
happened to be a Jewish holiday

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.550
and we still wanted to go forward with this date,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.550
but we do understand that those that are very strong

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.470
in their faith maybe can't make it today.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.750
So we are gonna make it available and please sit down.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.790
We're actually gonna provide documentation

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.310
to go along with this.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.959
James is gonna go a little bit more at a very high level

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.639
over some of the use cases for catalog source

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.660
and then we'll get into more visual representation

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.620
of what you do.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.860
So I picked the catalog sources and initial topic to work on

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.160
because it is the main tool

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.399
to manage your catalog content,

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:13.399
whether that's rich attribute data or quantity or pricing,

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:19.220
but it is the main tool to handle external data

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.639
is it's getting imported into EVP

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.540
and a lot of the functions you can achieve

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.639
with catalog source, if you can manage

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.459
and set them up on your own,

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:31.600
you can eliminate the need to get your CSM

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.540
to do it for you, which allows you to set up,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.139
for example, a supplier at a much reduced cost

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:40.079
because you're doing the work to set up 75% of it

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:41.379
with the catalog source.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.560
Again, the catalog source is a tool

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.980
to import external data while also analyzing it

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.139
and doing some checks and balances.

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.800
Obviously your EVP catalog is,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.740
you want that to be very clean and organized

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.579
and when you're importing data,

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:06.819
historically it could be very easy to mess up your catalog

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:08.220
with the catalog source tool.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.220
That's not as much of a risk.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.500
It's designed to handle flat files,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.120
CSV, XML, text.

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:22.720
We do work with APIs that build files,

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.199
but again, I have external data I need to deal with

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:29.319
and I want it in my system to be utilized somehow.

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.959
This is the tool you want to know,

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:33.660
be very familiar with so you can deal

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.100
with that business scenario.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.399
I know that a while back we had a client

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:42.279
that literally had hundreds and hundreds

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.740
of non-integrated dropship suppliers

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.500
and during their implementation time period,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.500
they got up to speed on catalog source very, very quickly

00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:58.459
and during their implementation period,

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:04.379
created, took 350 of those dropship suppliers

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.500
and turned them into fully integrated suppliers for themselves.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.079
For the brands out there,

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:15.920
there are just as many reasons to use catalog source,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.560
whether it's doing some additional content

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.000
or high quality content.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.199
There's working with 3PL or fulfillment partners.

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:32.879
There are hundreds of uses for catalog source.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:37.200
Some basic rundown of a catalog source usage scenario

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.879
is you get external data,

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.019
you load that data into a catalog source,

00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:45.179
which I like to think of as a loading dock.

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:50.580
You apply mappings, you add mappings to the catalog source

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.340
and what a mapping is, is a bridge.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.299
I'm saying this external data, I have this field

00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:59.220
and that means this in EVP and you're building that linkage.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.659
So if I have a skew in the external file,

00:09:02.659 --> 00:09:05.419
I tell it that this is the channel skew in EVP

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:10.080
or if this attribute equates to this attribute

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.240
or this MPN is actually not the one in my system,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.360
so I'm just gonna load it as an attribute.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.740
So you build those mappings, you then analyze and validate.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.279
The analyze and validate step looks at the external data

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:28.120
and checks that UPCs are valid,

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.720
runs through any analysis mappings you have,

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.639
which can do things like check if the price

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.460
is below a certain amount,

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.639
look for keywords and titles that need to be excluded.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.139
But again, it's vetting the data bit.

00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:44.259
Then you apply the maps.

00:09:44.259 --> 00:09:46.580
Applying the maps builds that bridge

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.500
that you've kind of outlined in setting up the mappings

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.980
and links and attempts to link the external data

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.980
to an internal skew in EVP so that you have a clean bridge.

00:09:58.379 --> 00:09:59.860
So you know ahead of time,

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.580
when I click step four and import this data,

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.039
I know where it's gonna go and what it's gonna do.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:08.679
Again, that's the real power behind a catalog source

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:11.500
is you can preview the behavior of the import

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.000
before you do so,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.440
so you're not scrambling to clean up something

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.679
if a column was off or whatnot.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.720
And then lastly, you can import the data

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.159
and then if there's a need for it,

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:26.559
you set up an automation so we can regularly import things

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:31.559
like cost updates, quantity, new images, stuff like that.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.860
And that all comes to play

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.960
when you automate the catalog source.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.899
All right, get ready James.

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:45.740
I'm going to make you the new host

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:54.080
as soon as I hit the correct button again

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.360
and you have the ball.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:02.330
So there you go.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.250
As of right now, I don't see a lot of questions coming in.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.769
When they do come in,

00:11:07.809 --> 00:11:10.450
if they're pertinent to what we're covering right at this

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.549
moment, we may insert them in,

00:11:12.549 --> 00:11:14.769
but we are gonna have a time near the end

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:17.970
where we can handle those questions.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.750
Any questions that we don't get to

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.929
or any questions that are very, very specific

00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:28.029
to maybe some catalog sources you're currently running

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:32.210
or very unique problems to something that you're doing,

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.049
please discuss with your CSM.

00:11:34.049 --> 00:11:36.250
We're here, we're here to help

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.090
and we're on the line to kind of understand

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.570
what are our clients thinking

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:47.759
and how can we help them better utilize this tool?

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:52.759
Yes, and again, our goal here is to pique your interest,

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.820
give you some surface level details.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.460
The documentation I've written up

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.879
goes into a bit more detail.

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:03.179
But again, this is to get you thinking about

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:07.220
how can I utilize catalog sources in creative ways?

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.340
Some of you may be familiar with its usage

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.580
as a supplier integration mechanism,

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.899
but there's a lot of different ways.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:16.220
So again, this is to show you the basics

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.220
so that you can kind of go,

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.980
hey, I've learned a bit about it.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.340
Do you think we could do this?

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.659
And then you have a conversation with your CSM

00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:25.460
and we can see what we can achieve.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.980
So as you log into EDP,

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.940
you're always welcome to the sales order screen

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.620
where you see your lovely sales.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.659
To navigate to the catalog source screen,

00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:36.059
you go to the catalog module

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:38.179
and then you go to catalog sources.

00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:39.620
First thing you're gonna notice

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.259
is that they are channel specific.

00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:44.100
When you're utilizing a catalog source,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:52.110
you're updating the data on a specific channel.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.509
You can create a new catalog source up here.

00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:56.710
You can create them from marketplaces

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.870
or for your ETail channel

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.389
or for your various supplier channels.

00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:06.960
So in this case, I'm gonna create a new one.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.480
Just gonna get rid of our test one.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.360
I'm gonna do new catalog source

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.009
and I'm gonna select from a file.

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:17.649
You're gonna see this window here.

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:18.830
You're gonna hit the spy glass

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.710
that's gonna allow you to find that external data.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.389
I like to use the metaphor of this external data

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:27.230
as a truckload of information

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.470
and I don't wanna just throw it from my truck

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:30.470
into my warehouse.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.629
I wanna bring it onto a loading dock,

00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:34.269
organize it, understand it

00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:36.509
and then move it into my warehouse.

00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:38.549
So my warehouse stays nice and organized.

00:13:38.549 --> 00:13:40.470
Again, your EDP catalog,

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.990
you want as pristine as possible

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.309
because in the e-commerce world, content is king.

00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:48.590
And so if your content isn't up to par

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.470
being kept updated,

00:13:51.929 --> 00:13:54.110
as you all know, you have struggles.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:57.259
So I select the file

00:13:57.259 --> 00:14:02.179
and I'm gonna get a preview here.

00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:04.460
I'm gonna hit this configure button

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.039
and here you have various options.

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:07.759
The main ones you'll probably utilize

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:09.919
are telling it how that file is delimited.

00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:12.580
As you can see here, we have a number of options.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.460
You're also going to typically indicate

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.139
that your file has column headers.

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:18.259
So I can see here,

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:21.259
I have a column header for these various fields

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:23.419
but it's not the first row.

00:14:23.419 --> 00:14:25.840
So I'm going to skip the first row

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.740
and say the first row I don't skip has headers.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.159
I hit okay, you'll see this preview.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.139
Again, this is a preview of the catalog source

00:14:36.139 --> 00:14:38.779
showing you what the headers are

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:40.419
and everything looks parsed correctly.

00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:42.340
So I'm gonna hit save.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.259
By default catalog source will be named

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:49.580
the same as the file you used to create it.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.539
Once you've created the initial catalog source,

00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:53.980
you'll be welcomed by this screen

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.379
showing you that it's loading the data.

00:14:56.379 --> 00:14:59.419
Again, at this point, we're putting the data,

00:14:59.419 --> 00:15:01.419
we're taking the data off of that truck

00:15:01.419 --> 00:15:04.220
and putting it onto a loading dock so we can organize it.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.620
Once the data is loaded,

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.159
you come to this screen and you hit refresh tab

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:10.500
and you'll see the data.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.580
There's a rule of thumb.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.460
Everything in this yellow is the external data.

00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:19.840
It looks like if you did this a few times,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.179
almost everybody could learn how to use this

00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:25.360
with just a few practice times.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.480
It's pretty straightforward.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.480
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.840
And again, I picked this topic

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.379
because the more familiar with the catalog source

00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:35.600
and the more comfortable you are using it,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.600
the more empowered you are to A, manage your catalog

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.179
and B, diagnose a lot of issues.

00:15:41.179 --> 00:15:43.000
I get a lot of people asking,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.700
they submit tickets, hey, inventory didn't update.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.360
It takes you five seconds to check this automation time

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.559
and go, oh, we didn't get a file.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:53.080
I didn't need to reach out or create a support ticket.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.799
I just needed to understand how the catalog source works

00:15:56.799 --> 00:15:58.120
and then I can check it myself

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.720
and I can go, oh, we didn't get a file.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.080
I need to reach out to the supplier to get file.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.399
They've stopped putting it on the FTP.

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:07.490
Perfect, yeah.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.649
So after you've loaded your data,

00:16:10.649 --> 00:16:12.169
you're gonna come to this columns tab

00:16:12.169 --> 00:16:13.570
and you establish your mappings.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.149
Again, a mapping is a bridge.

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:17.970
I'm saying, this is my external data.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.450
What does that mean in EVP?

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.690
So in this case, I know that the skew is the skew.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.169
And for example, we're just gonna load quantity.

00:16:27.169 --> 00:16:32.080
So I know that the supplier stock is the quantity.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.960
But again, you have all these options.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.639
I would learn and get familiar

00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:37.960
with all of the mapping options you have available

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.879
because again, these are the bridges I can build

00:16:40.879 --> 00:16:43.320
between external data and what it means in EVP.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.320
You have a lot of options in various areas.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.159
Getting familiar with these mapping options

00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:50.399
will be very helpful for you and your team.

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:53.240
Once you've set up your mappings,

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.799
you're gonna save and close and reopen the catalog source.

00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:03.570
Now on the mappings tab, you will see your mappings.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.269
One mapping I wanna call out,

00:17:06.269 --> 00:17:09.890
you can change the map type to a custom script.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.650
A custom script allows us to achieve a lot of complexity

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:18.170
when we're handling data, some example usages.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.369
The supplier doesn't provide a very good title.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.130
So I wanna combine multiple fields to make a title.

00:17:25.529 --> 00:17:28.809
The supplier provides their wholesale costs,

00:17:28.809 --> 00:17:30.130
but I get a discounted rate.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.490
So I need to take a percentage off of the value in the file.

00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:38.049
Those are just two examples.

00:17:38.049 --> 00:17:40.490
But again, the custom script allows you to achieve

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.210
a lot of complexity within the catalog source

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.250
when dealing with the data.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:48.369
So never shy away from asking the question to your CSM.

00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:49.730
Hey, do you think we can do this?

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.130
Because the answer is probably we can work

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.289
with the development team to build a custom script

00:17:55.289 --> 00:17:56.289
that does do that.

00:17:58.049 --> 00:18:00.450
So it doesn't just have to be your dealing with raw data.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:06.000
You can manipulate it as you're importing it.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.039
Remember, you can ask questions at any time.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.480
Our other CSMs, Jason and James,

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.680
or excuse me, Jeff Baker are reviewing those

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.640
and trying to get the right ones to me at the right time.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.759
One nuance with quantity loading

00:18:23.759 --> 00:18:25.559
is you do have to define a location.

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:26.559
So that's what I'm doing here.

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:33.599
I'm spelling at what location that quantity goes to.

00:18:33.599 --> 00:18:35.240
So once you've set up your mappings,

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.980
you're gonna do actions, analyze data.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.039
This is just gonna scan the data at a very high level.

00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:44.200
There is an analysis mapping option

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.039
which can do various checks, such as,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.359
and often if the UPC starts with five zeros,

00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:52.400
I don't wanna import it.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:59.819
That's part of the analysis check.

00:18:59.819 --> 00:19:02.700
I'm also gonna be told the max length

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.180
of the values in that field.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.859
So if one of these says my title is 10,000 characters long,

00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:10.579
I know there's probably some issue with my data.

00:19:10.579 --> 00:19:11.900
And that's good, I've checked it.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.740
I've identified an issue before I've imported it.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.500
Again, within the catalog source, you're in a loading dock.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.980
So you're not corrupting your EVP catalog at this point.

00:19:22.059 --> 00:19:27.640
You're identifying the flaws in your data ahead of time.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.240
So we're just gonna let this analyze

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.079
a little bit, a few more seconds.

00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:33.359
Well, you're letting it analyze, James.

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:35.319
How do you form...

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:39.640
How do formatting map errors alert you?

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.779
And will this cause all data to not load

00:19:43.779 --> 00:19:55.819
or only the specific fields that were incorrect?

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.359
Well, I think you're asking is if the analysis check

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:03.039
determines something's invalid, does it get imported?

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.319
Okay.

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:08.039
And the answer would be no.

00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:08.880
Okay.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.039
So for example, it happens a lot with UPC,

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:13.680
the system detects that a UPC in the external data

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.160
is invalid, that is identified during the analysis check

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.500
and it doesn't let you import that invalid UPC.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.559
If you don't have a mapping for a field,

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:28.079
there's no bridge, so the data is left alone.

00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:29.000
It's not imported.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.960
So in this case, I'm ignoring all this data

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.799
and I'm just importing the quantity by matching on this view.

00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:36.680
Got it.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.400
And remember, if we don't get to your question right away,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.759
we're gonna be covering as many as we can

00:20:42.759 --> 00:20:45.720
during the question and answer session.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.519
And at the end of James,

00:20:50.519 --> 00:20:54.549
just kind of running through this right now.

00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:56.950
One thing I like to emphasize

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.789
when training people on the catalog source

00:20:58.789 --> 00:21:02.349
is you have four options for creating a link.

00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:04.630
Well, you technically have five options.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:09.150
Creating a link from the external data to a SKU

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.630
or a master SKU and EVP,

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.430
because that's the real first step

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:17.029
is telling the system what SKU and the EVP

00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:18.890
I need to be updating.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.670
And so your options are SKU,

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.230
you can match on the channel SKU,

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.670
you can match on the master SKU,

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.430
you can match on a UPC, a part number,

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.720
or an attribute.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.519
If you wanna match on those beyond master SKU and SKU,

00:21:35.519 --> 00:21:37.319
you would configure that here.

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:39.759
And again, that allows you to build that bridge

00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:42.599
between the external data and what it is in EVP.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.880
So on step three,

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.960
we're actually gonna try and apply the maps

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.359
that we've set up and build that bridge.

00:21:50.359 --> 00:21:53.599
What I also like to emphasize is these first three steps,

00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:54.720
you're relatively safe.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.279
You're not gonna corrupt your EVP catalog

00:21:58.279 --> 00:22:00.079
by doing these first three steps.

00:22:00.079 --> 00:22:03.079
They are contained within that loading stage.

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:05.480
So when apply maps,

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.279
you can see here the results of that.

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:09.599
I'm matching on SKU, which is good.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.240
Again, yellow is external data.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.599
Green is telling me,

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:15.720
the green section is telling me,

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.400
okay, this is the channel SKU.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.960
And again, I'm on a specific channel.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.480
And then this is the master SKU

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.880
and these look could be correct.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.380
There's no numbers line up.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.660
So this is where you can check your results

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.619
before you import,

00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:33.220
which is really powerful because again,

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.859
it lets you find flaws in your data.

00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:36.700
It lets you see,

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.140
hey, I'm not matching on a bunch of stuff.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.500
Does that mean the data is wrong?

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.700
Or do I have potential SKUs I can create?

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.900
Yeah, the last thing you wanna do

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.740
is corrupt your catalog in EVP.

00:22:50.259 --> 00:22:54.259
Typically you have to reach out to your CSM

00:22:54.259 --> 00:22:56.220
and have them help you fix it,

00:22:57.019 --> 00:23:00.460
which is distracting from growth driving business.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.900
So once you've applied the maps,

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.339
you'll see the matches,

00:23:06.339 --> 00:23:08.380
you'll see where it didn't match.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.740
This screen here is exportable

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.700
and can be exported into Excel.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.980
So you can kind of filter out,

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.900
identify stuff that didn't match,

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:24.180
do various layers of manipulation if needed.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.579
After it's applied the maps,

00:23:25.579 --> 00:23:27.279
you would do action step four,

00:23:27.279 --> 00:23:28.960
which would load the data

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.240
to the record it's built a bridge to.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.640
If I, I'm gonna let this run,

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.319
let's go take a second.

00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:38.279
I'm gonna cover the settings really quick.

00:23:38.279 --> 00:23:40.119
Again, I talked about the matching.

00:23:40.119 --> 00:23:42.440
This allows us to match to data points

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.880
beyond SKU and master SKU.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.160
The other section you're gonna be wanna,

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.720
going to want to be familiar with

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.920
is the create and update.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.519
I cover this a bit more in depth

00:23:52.519 --> 00:23:54.400
on the documentation that we will provide,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.400
but essentially think of catalog items as master SKUs.

00:23:59.839 --> 00:24:03.059
Do I wanna create or update master SKUs?

00:24:03.059 --> 00:24:06.079
You should be familiar with master SKU level details

00:24:06.079 --> 00:24:11.079
like a master, a title, UPC, UOM information.

00:24:11.119 --> 00:24:13.400
Those are all stored at the master SKU level.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.559
Then do I wanna create or update channel records?

00:24:17.559 --> 00:24:22.559
This is typically attributes, images, stuff like that.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.930
A channel record can be a supplier record

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.849
or a marketplace record.

00:24:29.849 --> 00:24:32.329
But again, if I need to create a channel record,

00:24:32.329 --> 00:24:34.769
I have to have a master SKU.

00:24:34.769 --> 00:24:37.450
So, but this will control how we update

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:42.500
or create master SKUs and SKUs.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.299
So as I applied map, we're almost done there.

00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:47.420
You would do action step four and load the data,

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.500
which we may or may not get to.

00:24:50.579 --> 00:24:51.940
But that's the very basics.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.579
You're getting your external data,

00:24:54.579 --> 00:24:57.579
you're importing it to a catalog source,

00:24:57.579 --> 00:25:00.460
you're establishing your mappings,

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.900
you're applying your mappings and analyzing the results

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.700
and then you're importing the data.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.259
And again, the power behind the catalog source

00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:10.900
is once you've set it up, you can automate it.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.539
So if that file is regularly available,

00:25:13.539 --> 00:25:16.059
you can set up automation so we pull that file.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.460
You also have the ability to check the data

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.460
before you import it,

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.339
which when setting up a new catalog for a new supplier is huge.

00:25:26.339 --> 00:25:27.180
And again-

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.700
So James, just let me reiterate,

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.819
in these 10, 12 minutes, we've taken an external file,

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.619
brought it in DVP, corrected it,

00:25:38.619 --> 00:25:41.339
analyzed it, created our mappings

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:46.019
and imported 21,000 new items into our catalog

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.059
that once you have the quantity or the,

00:25:51.059 --> 00:25:53.299
you said what you wanna do in the pricing,

00:25:53.299 --> 00:25:57.380
you got 20,000 new products up on your sales channels,

00:25:58.619 --> 00:26:00.140
ready to go.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.460
Yeah, I mean, if we were creating supplier records here,

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.420
you'd get your item creators to run

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:09.420
and yeah, you could add 21,000 new listings for each channel.

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:12.259
Fantastic.

00:26:12.259 --> 00:26:15.539
And again, I emphasize that getting familiar

00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:16.859
with the catalog source,

00:26:16.859 --> 00:26:20.500
A, allows you to set up flat file suppliers on your own

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.420
and B, diagnose what's going on

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.819
with the automation that's been set up.

00:26:25.819 --> 00:26:28.539
Okay, another quick question for you.

00:26:28.539 --> 00:26:32.019
How does it work when a supplier's inventory record

00:26:33.059 --> 00:26:35.619
drops from their feed?

00:26:35.619 --> 00:26:39.339
Will it expire the inventory and set it to zero?

00:26:39.339 --> 00:26:43.220
So if somebody had a hundred items in their normal feed

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.019
and now there's only 99.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.140
Yeah, you can configure the system to behave in various ways

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.099
when that occurs.

00:26:51.099 --> 00:26:54.259
So in the availability section you've seen here,

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:57.500
if I check expire and after days,

00:26:58.539 --> 00:27:02.339
if the specific SKU has not had quantity loaded

00:27:02.339 --> 00:27:04.980
from this file in three days,

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.299
we will expire the inventory.

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:08.339
So if you'll want to expire right away,

00:27:08.339 --> 00:27:11.140
I would check the box and leave it at zero.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:14.460
You can also define behavior for if no file is found.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.420
So the supplier stops dropping off a file,

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.700
we can expire everything

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.819
if we don't find a file after X amount of days.

00:27:21.819 --> 00:27:25.259
So you do have options to expire availability

00:27:25.259 --> 00:27:27.500
if the row is dropped from the file.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.420
So it sounds like we thought of everything.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.259
If you can think of the example,

00:27:32.259 --> 00:27:35.420
we're gonna cover it somehow.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.539
Okay.

00:27:36.539 --> 00:27:37.380
Yeah.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.420
James, why don't you throw it back over to me?

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:54.740
Sounds good.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:00.039
Okay, this is the one thing we have to figure out

00:28:00.039 --> 00:28:01.599
as we do these monthly

00:28:01.599 --> 00:28:03.119
to be a little bit more efficient

00:28:03.119 --> 00:28:06.960
in the passing of the baton, but we'll get better.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.440
We also would be on saying what we should do

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.079
in these webinars,

00:28:13.079 --> 00:28:16.319
give us suggestions on how we can get better.

00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:18.440
This is our first one.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.359
I know I'm just killing it,

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:23.079
and I'm kind of dragging James along,

00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:26.799
but what can we do to make this more interesting,

00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:29.640
more pertinent, or just more enjoyable?

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.480
I can tell jokes.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.519
Some of the uses, we did the demo,

00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:38.359
some of the real uses,

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:40.119
let's think about how to use it.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.920
We've given you literally how easy it is to use.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.759
I don't think any of you that were at novices

00:28:50.759 --> 00:28:54.319
coming in today would consider yourself experts,

00:28:54.319 --> 00:28:58.119
but you now understand what the power is.

00:28:58.119 --> 00:29:01.599
One of our future sessions may give you

00:29:01.599 --> 00:29:05.319
additional tools and techniques on how to use this,

00:29:05.319 --> 00:29:07.680
but now you know what it's for

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.519
and how you can use it for your business.

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:13.880
You can import content, images

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.759
to improve the quality of your listings.

00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:20.720
You can set up those supplier integrations

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.440
for inventory level information.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.759
Nobody likes to have their ODR go down

00:29:25.759 --> 00:29:29.759
because they ran out of inventory

00:29:29.759 --> 00:29:32.440
in their dropship suppliers,

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.200
and you want to be able to sell at a price

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.480
that's a good price for you.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.480
Win the buy box, but make some profit, make some margin.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.880
James, you can probably address the last bullet point

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.359
a little bit better than I can.

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:50.640
Yeah, so again, content, supplier integrations

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.200
are the primary ways in which catalog sources are used,

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:59.230
and another way they can be used

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.509
is with the active inventory option.

00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:05.630
So on marketplaces, instead of using an external file,

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.789
I can build a file based on the active inventory

00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:09.829
on that marketplace.

00:30:09.829 --> 00:30:13.349
So what you would see in the new catalog source dropdown

00:30:13.349 --> 00:30:15.549
on a channel like Amazon is an option

00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:17.630
to choose active inventory.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.390
That uses the API connection to build a file

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.829
of everything that's existing out on the marketplace

00:30:23.829 --> 00:30:26.029
that's active at that point in time,

00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:31.029
and allows you to do a comparison of what's going on in EVP.

00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:34.029
Historically, people would have to export something

00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:36.470
from EVP, export something from the marketplace,

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:38.869
put Excel files right next to each other.

00:30:38.869 --> 00:30:41.190
With the active inventory catalog source,

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.549
you can do that comparison within the application,

00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:48.670
and then take action without having to go from a file

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.430
to Excel to a file to an application.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.190
You can do all that assessment in comparison with an EVP.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:57.430
I've seen a lot of creative usages with that.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:02.430
One example is you can diagnose and make sure

00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:05.789
that shipping templates are in sync,

00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:10.789
and identify items that are potentially having issues

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:16.279
that are making them inactive.

00:31:16.279 --> 00:31:21.279
Okay, and we're getting towards the end of our time

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.319
with you as much as we're enjoying it.

00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:27.079
We're in that question and answer session,

00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:29.559
and I'm not gonna use any names here,

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:34.559
but can you use the catalog source to create variant groups

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:40.759
and assign your various items to the variant group?

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.319
Great question.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.559
It is a good question.

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:51.140
I've worked, the SME of variations on our team is Heather.

00:31:52.019 --> 00:31:56.380
I do believe that the catalog source can be utilized

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.420
to set up variations in child-parent relationships.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:06.940
Okay, obviously for more information, contact your CSM,

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.940
and if we need to have Heather jump on the call

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.819
or answer a few more questions, we'll figure that out.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.660
Here's another one we have.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:20.660
Can the catalog source be used to automate marketing data

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.220
that is sitting on a supplier FTP site?

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:28.900
For example, supplier gives us marketing data weekly.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:33.819
Can we automatically grab the new file and load it in the VP?

00:32:33.819 --> 00:32:36.019
I mean, usually when we talk about automate,

00:32:36.019 --> 00:32:38.220
we're talking hourly, daily.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.220
What about setting them up a week apart?

00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:44.859
Yeah, the schedules can be set to any sort of cadence.

00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:48.900
Yes, you could import marketing data

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.140
from suppliers on a weekly basis.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.099
You would also wanna look at and work with your CSM

00:32:55.099 --> 00:32:58.140
on utilizing the attribute mappings

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.500
so that that data as it's updated on the supplier record

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.099
gets pushed up to the marketplace to supplier lists

00:33:05.099 --> 00:33:07.059
or sales listings.

00:33:07.059 --> 00:33:09.980
But you could definitely pull a file from an FTP

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.099
or have them drop it off on ours, import it weekly,

00:33:13.099 --> 00:33:17.059
and that updates attribute level marketing details.

00:33:17.059 --> 00:33:18.660
And then if you have attribute maps,

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.859
which essentially take an attribute from one channel

00:33:20.859 --> 00:33:22.700
and populate it on another,

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.539
that would automatically be updated and republished

00:33:26.539 --> 00:33:28.859
as that content is imported.

00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:32.819
Okay, here's gonna be a really good one.

00:33:32.819 --> 00:33:36.660
How do you pull current catalog sources

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:41.180
and their mapping already in EVP

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:48.539
so that you can use this as a template?

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:53.539
So I think I'm gonna answer this question correctly.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.579
If I set up a catalog source

00:33:55.579 --> 00:33:59.259
and I have a bunch of intricate mappings

00:33:59.259 --> 00:34:02.180
with custom scripts and whatnot,

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.140
and I wanna reuse those mappings

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.220
and a different catalog source,

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.739
you can export mappings

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:11.219
and re-import them on other catalog sources.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.940
So the mappings can be exported into a map file

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.420
and then re-import it on a different catalog source.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.260
Perfect.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:25.260
And will the catalog source replace the MCIs in the future?

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:29.619
Is it possible to add MCIs functionality

00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:35.710
into the catalog source?

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.110
By the way, James,

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:40.349
I don't know, it's an appropriate question for some of these.

00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:42.789
What I would wanna know is the things you're doing

00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:47.710
with the MCI that you can't do with the catalog source

00:34:47.789 --> 00:34:50.110
because I haven't run into that scenario very often.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.750
You can pretty much,

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.030
we would like to see you use the catalog source

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.869
more and more again,

00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:57.550
because it has that checks and balances.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.750
The MCI has its purpose in its place,

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:02.389
but I always try and use the catalog source first.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:04.750
So I'd want more details

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.550
on what you aren't able to achieve

00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:10.630
with the catalog source that you are with the MCI.

00:35:11.869 --> 00:35:16.789
So a great example of reach out directly to your CSM,

00:35:16.789 --> 00:35:19.829
have that very thorough discussion

00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:21.590
about what you're trying to do,

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.110
how you're using the MCIs,

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.110
and how we would do that same,

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:29.710
those same set of functions in the catalog source,

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.989
or what do you believe might be missing?

00:35:31.989 --> 00:35:33.630
But a very good question.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.469
I would just end with, on that note,

00:35:40.239 --> 00:35:42.199
I'll move on to the next question.

00:35:42.199 --> 00:35:43.039
Okay.

00:35:43.039 --> 00:35:47.000
Do you know when some listings fail to be created?

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.119
We always have to fix the column,

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:55.559
mostly authorized or manufacturing alignment issues

00:35:55.559 --> 00:35:58.639
when we manually create the listings,

00:35:58.639 --> 00:36:03.440
but ETL doesn't really show us such details.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.440
I guess that question is already being answered.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.840
So look forward in your chat box,

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:12.960
because one of our CSMs has jumped onto that one.

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:18.599
What if there are a bunch of product categories

00:36:19.199 --> 00:36:23.239
or a certain manufacturer, I don't want to load.

00:36:23.239 --> 00:36:26.760
Can I block the manufacturer or category from loading?

00:36:27.639 --> 00:36:28.480
Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:33.480
Again, the analysis mapping allows you to set up

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.119
various if-then statements.

00:36:38.119 --> 00:36:41.320
So if I meet this condition, then I don't import.

00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:45.039
You can look for strings of text.

00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:48.840
You can look at the starting string and say,

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.559
hey, if it starts with this,

00:36:50.559 --> 00:36:53.559
you can look within the whole field and find a string.

00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:57.400
So there's a lot of options to exclude data

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.840
as it's getting imported,

00:37:00.039 --> 00:37:02.000
and only importing the data that you want

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.920
from the external file.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.760
Perfect.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.199
I think-

00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:08.559
Oh, I remember what I was gonna say.

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:12.400
If you left with processes that utilize the MCI

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.360
from historical processes that you just left with,

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.079
I would revisit those with your CSM

00:37:19.079 --> 00:37:23.929
to evaluate whether it makes sense to transition them.

00:37:23.929 --> 00:37:24.969
Okay.

00:37:24.969 --> 00:37:29.289
And one last question before we move on.

00:37:29.289 --> 00:37:34.289
Can the catalog import match with bulk image uploads

00:37:35.289 --> 00:37:43.780
if naming title schemes are followed?

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.340
Not sure I follow the question.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.659
I think what they're asking is,

00:37:46.659 --> 00:37:52.780
can I bulk import images

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:57.780
if the title of the image is the same?

00:38:00.469 --> 00:38:03.630
I'm gonna ask you to follow up with your CSM on that one,

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.269
but thank you for the question.

00:38:05.269 --> 00:38:08.989
What I would say is you can configure the catalog source

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:13.110
to either update or add images.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.550
So you can replace images

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.190
or you can add it as a secondary image.

00:38:18.269 --> 00:38:19.110
Okay.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:24.110
So next month, second Wednesday,

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:26.030
1 p.m. Eastern time,

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:29.869
you figure out the time adjustment for your time zone.

00:38:29.869 --> 00:38:31.909
You'll be getting an email.

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:36.150
You're gonna get invited again and please register.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:40.389
Even I know that sometimes the reminders

00:38:40.389 --> 00:38:44.349
or the final link can end up in your spam folder.

00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:46.150
So if you don't see the info,

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.670
please look in that spam folder.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:55.670
And while we have a series of these webinars planned out,

00:38:55.909 --> 00:38:59.349
we want you to direct us to where we go.

00:38:59.349 --> 00:39:02.829
If in your survey or through your conversations

00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:04.989
in your meetings with their CSM,

00:39:04.989 --> 00:39:08.269
we see other topics that are of higher value

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.630
to a greater number of people,

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:15.829
we will be more than happy to provide webinars on that.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:18.909
I want you to remember to fill,

00:39:18.909 --> 00:39:23.150
please fill out your survey at the end of the session.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.989
If you don't fill it online, you're gonna get an email.

00:39:26.949 --> 00:39:31.829
Also, before the beginning of every next webinar,

00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:34.429
we're gonna actually take a poll

00:39:34.429 --> 00:39:39.309
to judge the expertise level of the people attending

00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:44.309
and we can dial in how we present the information.

00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:46.869
We do wanna thank you

00:39:46.869 --> 00:39:50.429
for attending the first of TechEdges.

00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:53.590
We do wanna make a difference in your business.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:57.550
We do wanna become your most valuable tool

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.150
in your organization.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:01.269
And we will do anything and everything,

00:40:01.269 --> 00:40:04.190
well, almost everything we can do to make that happen.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.710
All your CSMs are around this afternoon.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.469
If you wanna fire them an email,

00:40:09.469 --> 00:40:12.590
we can cover this in your weeklies or monthlies.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:14.750
But thank you for attending.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.869
Please fill out the survey.

00:40:18.869 --> 00:40:21.710
And James, do you have any parting wise words

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:27.860
for the people that attended today?

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.739
Okay, no wise words.

00:40:29.739 --> 00:40:32.340
Learn about the mapping options on catalog sources

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.699
and I look forward to seeing you guys next time.

00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:35.619
Perfect.

00:40:35.619 --> 00:40:38.699
So a tool that's there,

00:40:38.699 --> 00:40:41.739
that is, I think everybody will recognize

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:45.900
is much easier to use than anybody thought

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.699
that can improve your business,

00:40:47.699 --> 00:40:50.340
increase your catalog size

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:54.500
and allow you to find ways to grow your business.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.699
Major wins in all ways.

00:40:56.699 --> 00:40:59.900
And with that, James and I are gonna sign off.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.980
Until next time, adios.
