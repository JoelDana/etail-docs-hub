1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
Well, here it is. A month has already gone by, and here we are at the June version of Tech Edge.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,920
For those of you that might be on vacation, lucky you.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,920
You're going to miss a great session today, but as always, you'll be able to find it on the Help Center

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,920
and review not only this one, but all the previous Tech Edges.

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,920
This month, once again, based on your input, we're going to be talking about pricing.

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,920
We're going to be talking about advanced pricing, taking repricing to that next level.

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:57,920
For those of you that this is your first Tech Edge, you're going to want to go back to our March Tech Edge.

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,920
Once again, you can get it through the Help Center. It gives you a link to the Knowledge Center,

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,920
and you'll be able to look at our pricing and repricing primer or first-level webinar

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,920
and maybe get more context or level set for some of the topics we're going to talk about today.

11
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:28,920
As always, Dr. James is going to be my co-host today, but I think in the coming months,

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,920
we're going to start seeing some new people take on this role.

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Thank you for coming. Remember, you can always get the video after the session.

14
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,920
James, take it away.

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,920
As Jeff mentioned, I encourage you to look at the previous repricing webinar to get your footing

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,920
in terms of the basics, in terms of policy assignment, and overall,

17
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,920
it gives you a lot of the background knowledge you need to engage in this material.

18
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,920
We're going to discuss repricing triggers in a more specific way than last time,

19
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,920
looking at some of the more powerful ones and how they're utilized.

20
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Spend some time discussing UPP management, how that's handled in EVP.

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Look at the price parity option really quickly and how that can be leveraged.

22
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Discuss lookup tables once more, reiterating how they should be leveraged

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,920
and what you need, the mindset you should be putting yourself in

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,920
when thinking about how am I going to use them.

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Then lastly, we'll end with some Q&A.

26
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,260
Our mission is always to drive growth and profits for you guys through our platform.

27
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,260
The goal of these webinars is to educate you to enable you to, in this case,

28
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,260
offer a more competitive price or capture more margin when repricing.

29
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,260
Hopefully, one of the... I'm sorry, James.

30
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,260
I think one of the other things that we're learning more and more from some of our clients

31
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,260
is helping them find some cost savings initiatives,

32
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,260
finding ways to be more efficient,

33
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:17,260
finding ways to not always have to add people to accomplish highly repetitious kind of tasks.

34
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,260
Increasing margin and profits,

35
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:29,260
while we often think about sales and revenue growth as the primary way to do that,

36
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,260
many times helping you be more efficient in your operations

37
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,260
can also achieve the same goal of being more profitable.

38
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,510
Yep.

39
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,510
We'll first discuss price event trigger,

40
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,510
what that does and how it can be leveraged, sales velocity trigger,

41
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,510
a whole buy box policy and what that looks like,

42
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,510
and then an FBA stock age policy,

43
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:02,510
exploring how you would leverage the stock age trigger to implement that.

44
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,510
Jumping right in, the first trigger is the price event trigger.

45
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,510
A very simple explanation is when we reach a certain price point,

46
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,510
we take an action and move the item to a new policy.

47
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,510
The price points are the floor target and ceiling calculated by the formulas

48
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,510
that are associated with policies.

49
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:29,510
The main thing you can leverage this trigger for is to prevent price stagnation.

50
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:34,510
You may have a seek loop or you're using a relative amount policy,

51
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,510
but the behavior you're seeing is items get to the floor and they sit there.

52
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,510
There's no next action.

53
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,510
There's no competitive factor.

54
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,510
I can't lower my price anymore, so I'm sitting at my floor.

55
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,510
I encourage you to look at any policy you have where items get to the floor

56
00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:02,510
and sit there and add a price event trigger for at floor.

57
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,510
You could move it into a seek rule that seeks up.

58
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,510
You can move it into a policy with a higher floor to jump the price up,

59
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,510
but what you're trying to address is preventing price stagnation

60
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:19,420
either sitting at the floor or the target or the ceiling.

61
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,420
You can have an initial policy that's using relative amount.

62
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,420
Again, a relative amount is I'm looking at a competitor's price

63
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,420
and I'm trying to beat it by a certain amount.

64
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,420
Have a price event trigger within a relative amount policy that says,

65
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,420
if my relative amount gets me to my floor,

66
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,420
I'm going to move it to a policy that instigates new behavior.

67
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,420
Maybe I see, maybe I adjust my formula,

68
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,420
but again, relative amount competed me down to my floor.

69
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,420
I still didn't win the buy box or I still didn't achieve my sales velocity goals,

70
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,420
so I need to do something besides just sit at my floor

71
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,420
or try and compete against the other sellers with a relative amount.

72
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,420
I encourage people to jump to the ceiling if they reach the floor

73
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:11,420
and what you will find is a lot of other re-pricing engines will chase you.

74
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,420
They chase you down, they just as well might likely chase you up.

75
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:21,420
If I reach my floor, I often encourage clients to move it to a policy

76
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,420
that spikes the price up, monitor the re-pricing results screen,

77
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,420
see if your competitors follow you,

78
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,420
and then you know you can manipulate your price off the floor

79
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:37,420
on certain skews when that price event occurs.

80
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,420
James, I think sometimes this is counterintuitive.

81
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,420
If you're not winning at the bottom,

82
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,420
how can jumping to the top help you?

83
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,420
People will follow you, Amazon will follow you as you go up,

84
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,420
and then if you're the first one to drop,

85
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,420
you create a window where you can be very successful.

86
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,390
Exactly.

87
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,390
The sales velocity trigger is one you may be familiar with,

88
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,390
but it is, in my opinion,

89
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,390
one of the more powerful triggers we have

90
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:19,390
in that it gives you an alternative to relative amount.

91
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,390
I keep saying relative amount,

92
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,390
but the two options you have to compete

93
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,390
in an e-commerce re-pricing environment are relative amount,

94
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,390
i.e. I reference the price and try and beat it,

95
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,390
or B, I seek my price independent of other players.

96
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,390
What the sales velocity lets you do

97
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,390
is set up a sales velocity-based seek loop,

98
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,390
so what you do is you assess your sales velocity.

99
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,390
If I'm low sales, i.e. I'm below a threshold,

100
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,390
I move to a seek down,

101
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,390
and I lower my price until I hopefully start selling.

102
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,390
If I'm selling a lot, i.e. I'm above a threshold,

103
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,390
I want to see if I can capture a bit more margins

104
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,390
so I move the item to a seek up loop.

105
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,390
This checkbox you see here

106
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,390
will determine how we assess sales velocity.

107
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,390
If I check this box,

108
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,390
I will look at the sales of that skew

109
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,390
across all the listings on that channel.

110
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,390
On Amazon, I might have five or six ASINs

111
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,390
for a single skew.

112
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,390
If I want to look at my sales velocity

113
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,390
from that holistic perspective,

114
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,390
I would check this box.

115
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,390
If I want to just consider the sales velocity

116
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,390
of the individual listing, I leave it unchecked.

117
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,390
And that can be, that's really determined

118
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,390
on a kind of a product-by-product basis.

119
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,390
How many skews does this item have?

120
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,390
Are there reasons those skews would compete differently,

121
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,390
i.e. one's a UOM that doesn't sell as often

122
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,390
or has got a longer latency?

123
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,390
Whatever it may be, you have to make a determination.

124
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,390
Is the sales velocity of all these skews important

125
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,390
or are all these listings important

126
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,390
or is it more important to assess it on an individual basis?

127
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,390
Again, as I mentioned, you want to leverage

128
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,390
the sales velocity trigger into a seek loop

129
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,390
is the most standard in best practice function.

130
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,390
I often have someone use a relative amount

131
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,390
and the relative amount policy is their seed.

132
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,390
That's where things start.

133
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,390
And then I have the sales velocity trigger

134
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,390
within that relative amount.

135
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,390
So if the relative amount isn't winning the buy box

136
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,390
or generating the sales,

137
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,390
we change our competitive tactic to seek

138
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,390
and we see if that can generate sales.

139
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,390
Again, don't sleep on the seek up.

140
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,390
People get very focused on the seek down.

141
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,390
What do I do when I seek down?

142
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,390
Be creative with the seek up.

143
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,390
You can learn to manipulate other people's pricing

144
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,390
because their repricers are predictable.

145
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,390
If I go up, they're going to follow me.

146
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,390
If I have the buy box and I can seek up a bit

147
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,390
because my latency is a lot better than the other sellers,

148
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,390
that's another opportunity to use seek up.

149
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,390
I also love the seek up when my competition

150
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,390
is very low on inventory or maybe even stocked out

151
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,390
or if I've picked up a product line

152
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,390
where there's literally no other sellers,

153
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,390
why not find that balance point

154
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,390
where I can maintain my sales velocity

155
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,390
but also maximize my margin

156
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,390
and profitability on a product?

157
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,390
Mm-hmm.

158
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,390
One thing I'll comment about sales velocity is,

159
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,390
and I'm going to emphasize this later

160
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,390
in this PowerPoint presentation,

161
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:43,390
is it comes down to catalog segmentation.

162
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,390
Some clients have huge catalogs of 100,000 items.

163
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,390
Some only have 1,000,

164
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,390
but the better you can slice and dice that to say,

165
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,390
hey, I expect these items to sell really fast,

166
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,390
so I need to put them in a rule with a sales velocity trigger

167
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,390
that's appropriate verse.

168
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,390
I have these huge 1,000 UOM items that sell very slow,

169
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,390
so I need to have them in a separate policy

170
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,390
because their sales velocity is going to be different.

171
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,390
My expectations are going to be different,

172
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,390
so when you're thinking about how to segment my catalog,

173
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,390
a good place to start is,

174
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,390
I expect these things to be high-volume sellers.

175
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,390
I expect these things to be medium-volume sellers

176
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,390
and then low-volume sellers,

177
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,390
and then setting up initial sales velocity policies

178
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,390
that correlate to whether they're fast, slow, or medium sellers.

179
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,920
Next, we're going to talk about the whole buy box policy.

180
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
This is a combination of two triggers

181
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,920
that you should include in most of your Amazon rules

182
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,920
if you want to be buy box sensitive.

183
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
The first trigger is a price event trigger,

184
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,920
so you may or may not know when something happens on Amazon,

185
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
the buy box changes, the price changes,

186
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,920
the latency changes, an image is added.

187
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,920
It creates a notification event that we then download and assess,

188
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,920
and we can assess, hey, the notification we're getting

189
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,920
is indicated that we lost the buy box or we won the buy box,

190
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
and then we can instigate a behavior.

191
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,920
If I win the buy box while I'm in a relative amount policy,

192
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,920
I definitely want to move it to a hold buy box or seek up.

193
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,920
If I'm in a policy that's meant to hold the buy box

194
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,920
and I lose it, then I probably want to seek down

195
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,920
or move back to a relative amount.

196
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
The second trigger you're going to want to add

197
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,920
is the buy box status trigger.

198
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,920
So rather than looking at a price event to see if we win or loss,

199
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,920
this trigger simply checks who's in the buy box.

200
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,920
What's powerful about this is the buy box owner

201
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,920
can be self, FBA, FBM, or Amazon.

202
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,920
So I could have four different buy box status triggers

203
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,920
that then feed into if I'm competing against Amazon,

204
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
this is how I want to respond.

205
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
If I'm competing against an FBM merchant,

206
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,920
this is how I want to respond, and then with FBA similarly.

207
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,920
So I can decide based on who the seller is, what type of it is,

208
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,920
and then move it to a policy.

209
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
In a hold buy box rule, you want to check,

210
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
does the buy box owner equal self?

211
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,920
If it does not equal self, I need to likely instigate a behavior

212
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
because I've lost the buy box.

213
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
But with these two triggers,

214
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,920
you can find, exit, and enter prices for the buy box.

215
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,920
So again, you're going to the pricing results screen.

216
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,920
When did I enter a hold buy box rule?

217
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,920
That tells me what my price point is that got me the buy box.

218
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,920
When did I move out of a hold buy box policy?

219
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
That'll tell me what my price point is when I lost the buy box.

220
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,920
And looking at those trends can help you assess, you know,

221
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,920
all right, if I want to consistently hold the buy box,

222
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,320
I need to keep my ceiling below this.

223
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,320
On a lot of the triggers, you'll see this restore previous price option.

224
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,320
This can make a lot of sense when you're losing the buy box,

225
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,320
because again, it occurs during a reprice event.

226
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,320
So we may have calculated a new price when we detected the loss,

227
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
that price might have been higher.

228
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,320
So what this does is it says, if I apply this trigger,

229
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,320
use the previous price versus the one I've just calculated

230
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
that occurred during this event.

231
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
And again, if we lost the buy box,

232
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,320
we typically want to lower our price back down when that trigger makes

233
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,320
that that behavior occur.

234
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,630
The delay setting you see here and on a few other triggers,

235
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,630
it's pretty self-explanatory.

236
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,630
What it does if I set this to five minutes,

237
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,630
the item has to be in the policy for five minutes before this trigger

238
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,630
is applied.

239
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,630
So in a relative amount policy,

240
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,630
if I'm checking to see if I won the buy box,

241
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,630
I may delay it for an hour or two because I'm just,

242
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,630
want the natural, uh,

243
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,630
competitive behavior to occur for a period of time before I try and,

244
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,630
um,

245
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:13,880
instigate a series of behaviors based on winning or losing the buy box.

246
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,540
And again, this is very powerful to include within the seek loops.

247
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,540
I just previously mentioned in that, uh,

248
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,540
relative amount engages.

249
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,540
If I win the buy box, I hold it.

250
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,540
I'm seeking down.

251
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,540
If I lose the buy box,

252
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,540
I instigate a competitive behavior.

253
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,540
If I win the buy box,

254
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,540
I instigate a certain type of behavior.

255
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,540
But again, um,

256
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,540
when you're setting up your seek loops,

257
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,540
work with your CSM incorporate the whole buy box policy.

258
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,540
So that again,

259
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,540
if you're holding the buy box,

260
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,540
you're either keeping that margin or trying to increase it.

261
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:58,520
The stock age trigger can be used for FBM or FBA.

262
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Uh, we've seen a lot of success using it for FBA.

263
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,520
We're looking to improve your ability to use it with FBM.

264
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
But at a high level, what it does is it access,

265
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:14,520
it assesses the stock age of an item and it's low sales threshold.

266
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,520
And then moves the item to a new policy.

267
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,520
If those thresholds are met,

268
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,520
what I've done with some clients that's been successful as I've set up

269
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
stock age tiers.

270
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,520
So I have maybe four or five rules.

271
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Each rule has a lower floor.

272
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,520
So as stock age increases,

273
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,520
I'll have a stock age trigger that says if it's five days,

274
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
and then another in a different policy,

275
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,520
if it's 10 days, 30 days, uh, 60 days, you know,

276
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,520
the segments are something you can determine.

277
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
But as stock gets older,

278
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,520
I move the item to a policy with the lower floor.

279
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,520
And so what that's enabled people to do is, um,

280
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,520
in a, you know, automated way,

281
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,520
lower my floor price is my stock gets older to try and push it,

282
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
try and get rid of it. Um,

283
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,520
so that I can send new stock in, um,

284
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,520
again, each time we move to a new tier, we lower the floor.

285
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,520
You know, James, you could even go, go ahead.

286
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,520
I love this idea that occasionally as a stocking merchant,

287
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,520
uh, um, you're going to just, you're going to have a dog,

288
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
something that's not going to sell.

289
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
There's a better product out there,

290
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,520
but rather than waiting till the very last bullet that James is going to

291
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,520
talk about, where you just blow it out on a clearance sale,

292
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,520
where you're going at 30, 40, 50, 60% off.

293
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,520
When we see it doesn't, isn't selling early on,

294
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,520
maybe just a week or two, maybe a couple of weeks, whatever that,

295
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,520
that business rule for your business defines.

296
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Let's give up five or 10% margin rather than all my margin and take a loss

297
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
during the clearance sale.

298
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Yeah.

299
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,520
And you know, I'm just thinking creatively,

300
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
I could have that stock age, uh,

301
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,520
tier set of policies that I talked about is a stock age gets older.

302
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,520
I lower the tier or I lower the floor.

303
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Excuse me.

304
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Uh,

305
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
you could incorporate a sales velocity trigger within each one of those

306
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
policies.

307
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,520
So I reached here for, and all of a sudden I start selling it.

308
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
I don't want to,

309
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,520
I don't want to lower my floor now because I've started selling it.

310
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,520
So that sales velocity trigger applies, uh,

311
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,520
and moves it to a policy that says, Hey, keep this price point.

312
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
The stock's old, but it's selling.

313
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
So again,

314
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,520
the sky's the limit in terms of creativity, um,

315
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
with the EV, EV pricing options.

316
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
So, uh,

317
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,520
if anyone's interested in incorporating a, uh,

318
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,520
sales velocity trigger within their stock age loops, let me know.

319
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
And we can, we can see what we can achieve,

320
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
but I think that would be very powerful because again,

321
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,520
you seek down, you're lowering your floor.

322
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Eventually you'll read a price point where it sells and you can

323
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
identify that with a sales velocity trigger.

324
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Uh, some clients, uh, often deal with UPP or map price.

325
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Uh, for those unaware, that's a minimum advertised price or a universal

326
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
price policy.

327
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,920
It essentially means you can't sell below this point set by the

328
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
manufacturer. Typically.

329
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,920
One thing to know UPP can be stored on individual channel records.

330
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,920
So if I have a supply record, a sales channel record,

331
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,920
retail record, each one could have a different UPP stored.

332
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Um, we aggregate all the data being sent to us, you know,

333
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,920
sometimes there's discrepancies. Typically.

334
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,920
I always trust the manufacturer over a distributor.

335
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Um, and so I may have a content channel or, uh,

336
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,920
I know I'm always loading manufacturer data to the etail record.

337
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
Um,

338
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,920
but be aware of where that date is coming from and where it's being

339
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
stored in your system.

340
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,920
If you have multiple UPPs in your system,

341
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,920
if you go to system, the system module set up in the top banner,

342
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
you'll find UPP config.

343
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,920
We set up a basic logic statement on how it's handled.

344
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,920
If there's multiple UPPs present. So again,

345
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,920
I can have etail UPP view my source of truth.

346
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
And then if it's not there,

347
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,920
I kind of leverage other data or I can, you know,

348
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,920
this is the safest bet. I'm always using the highest.

349
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
It's a safe bet,

350
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,920
but it may mean that you're priced too high in some cases.

351
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
If you have bad data in the system.

352
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
But again,

353
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
work with your CSM.

354
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,920
If you're having UPP map management problems,

355
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
there's a number of tools available.

356
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Uh, there's a background checker that doesn't require a reprice event to

357
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
apply.

358
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,920
It simply checks UPP and what the price is and,

359
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
and moves it up.

360
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
If it texts it's below.

361
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Um,

362
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,920
how UPP works is it overrides the floor price.

363
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
So we calculate a floor price.

364
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
If the UPP stored, it overrides it.

365
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
So again,

366
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
go ahead, Jeff.

367
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Well, I was finished your top,

368
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,920
but before we move on, I'd like to add something.

369
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Uh,

370
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
this reiterating know where that date is coming from,

371
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,920
know where it's stored and know your options for how you can handle,

372
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
uh, the,

373
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
the multiple sources of that information.

374
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,920
I think for a brand clients that are either fairly new in the online

375
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
selling or been there for awhile.

376
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Uh, and not only sell retail or,

377
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,920
or a dropship for retailers,

378
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,920
um, or have actually authorized resellers.

379
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,920
I think it is so important to have a standardized pricing policy or an,

380
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,920
uh, have a map policy in place.

381
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
It will

382
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,920
either eliminate or vastly reduce the amount of channel conflict in the

383
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
marketplace.

384
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,920
It will help you clean up the gray market that has been eroding your brand

385
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,920
value and your brand image by willing to go, uh,

386
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,920
just keep going lower on the products that you manufacture and sell.

387
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,920
And it'll help create enforce with your approved sellers.

388
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
If you have some that,

389
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Hey, we're going to all play by the same rules now.

390
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,920
And it's really important as a brand to take control,

391
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,920
control that in the online environment.

392
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
That was what I was going to add.

393
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,830
Yeah.

394
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,830
You can be a pain in the butt if you're being held accountable.

395
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,830
But again, the tools made available in EDP help make that a lot easier to

396
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,830
deal with.

397
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,830
Um, I always encourage you to be proactive rather than reactive, uh,

398
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,830
with this stuff.

399
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,830
So having a good relation with your manufacturer,

400
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,830
so they're giving you that data at a time, uh,

401
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:16,830
knowing when you can expect UPP changes, you know,

402
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,830
automotive space it's yearly, you know, some, some brands are quarterly,

403
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,830
but, uh,

404
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,830
knowing when to expect those changes rather than getting the violation

405
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,830
notice and going and scrambling to fix it.

406
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,830
Also know that UPP can be a token within a formula and it can be

407
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,830
leveraged in selection criteria.

408
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,830
So you can simply say, Hey, if an item has a UPP greater than zero,

409
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,830
put it in a policy and the price is UPP.

410
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,830
Uh, I encourage you to be creative with it again,

411
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,830
just cause you have UPP doesn't mean you can't seek up a bit on

412
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,830
marketplaces to manipulate the price on your website.

413
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,830
You're a little more limited.

414
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:01,490
Uh, but the next option I wanted to cover,

415
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,490
I've gone over a lot of what you can do with policies and what you

416
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,490
can do with triggers and you want to segment your catalog.

417
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,490
And this can be a bit overwhelming if you then compound it with,

418
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,490
well,

419
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,490
I have six marketplaces to sign up, set up and reprice and get working

420
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,490
and flowing well. If you're feeling that way,

421
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,490
I encourage you to look at the price parity tool,

422
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,490
pick a channel that's going to be a price driver.

423
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,490
Amazon's a good one cause it's a competitive marketplace.

424
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,490
So there's things influencing the price.

425
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,490
Um, but maybe you want your Shopify your own website sales

426
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,490
velocity, being a price driver, whatever you're thinking through that

427
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:46,490
process, pick on a channel, focus on setting up the

428
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,490
repricing policies and lookup tables for that channel and

429
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,490
leverage the price parity option while, uh, you know,

430
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,490
you're tackling that channel and then you can tackle channel,

431
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:02,490
you know, your next channel and remove price parity.

432
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,490
Um, but again, it lets you tackle one channel,

433
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,490
set the others to price parity, um,

434
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,490
and then slowly work on each channel, um,

435
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,490
versus trying to figure them out all at once.

436
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,490
Very simply price parity has you reference a channel.

437
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,490
So in this case,

438
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,490
I'm looking at Amazon and I'm going to copy that price.

439
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,490
The mode you'll click that dropdown.

440
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,490
There's 60 different options.

441
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,490
I encourage you just to stick with match lowest delivered.

442
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,490
If you have very nuanced price parity objectives,

443
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,490
we can look at those other options,

444
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,490
but if you're using it for the first time,

445
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:44,280
use match lowest delivered so you understand the behavior factor

446
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,280
versus Delta, we can adjust the price.

447
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Um, we don't have to copy it one for one.

448
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,280
So in this case, uh,

449
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
let's say this is my eBay channel.

450
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,280
My eBay channel is going to look at my Amazon price and lower it

451
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,280
by 10%.

452
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,280
So this can be a way to, um,

453
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,280
you know, I may want the price parity on my website from Amazon,

454
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,280
but I always want my website to be cheaper.

455
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,280
That's the way you can achieve this.

456
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:18,010
Lastly, uh, I'm going to end on lookup tables.

457
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,010
I read, I brought this up on the last webinar,

458
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,010
but when you're looking at lookup tables,

459
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,010
you want to be,

460
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,010
this is the question you want to be asking yourself,

461
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,010
brainstorm with your team.

462
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,010
What variables impact my margin?

463
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:34,010
Bring that list to your CSM and engage with it.

464
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:38,010
We can identify which ones are handled by token like shipping cost,

465
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,010
item cost, uh, static overhead.

466
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,010
Um,

467
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,010
but then we can help identify the ones that aren't handled as tokens and

468
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,010
set them up as lookup tables.

469
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,010
Uh,

470
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,010
I wanted to call it overhead tokens because overhead can be a token.

471
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,010
You go to a location,

472
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,010
a supplier location on the fulfillment methods tab.

473
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,010
You can set up per order per item.

474
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,010
The limitation here is this is a static number.

475
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,010
If my overhead is dependent on weight or brand or,

476
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,010
um,

477
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,540
you know, uh,

478
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,540
a certain attribute value,

479
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,540
I can't dynamically adjust this value, but I can,

480
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,540
if I'm using lookup tables,

481
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,540
my overhead value can be dynamically adjusted based on item conditions.

482
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,540
So that's something to consider.

483
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,540
Do I have a flat overhead or do I have a dynamic overhead?

484
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,540
And so as you're looking at those,

485
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,540
those things that impact margin working on that list with your CSM,

486
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,540
you can set up the lookup tables to achieve the ultimate goal.

487
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,540
Which is to have your price policies drive your price behavior.

488
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,540
Do I seek up? Do I seek down? Do I compete based on my competitor?

489
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,540
Do I ignore my competitor? Do I just hold my price price behavior?

490
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,540
Then lookup tables handle.

491
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,540
Well, if it's this brand, my margin's different.

492
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,540
If it weighs over a hundred pounds, my margin's different.

493
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,540
Uh,

494
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,540
if, uh,

495
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,540
if it has attribute X,

496
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,540
then I need this overhead cost added. Um,

497
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,540
anything that's a dynamic variable impacting margin or costs,

498
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,540
we want to handle this lookup tables.

499
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,540
So you separate those two aspects of repricing into their, you know,

500
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,540
allotted swim lanes and you're not running into each other.

501
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,540
Oh, do I need to adjust my margin on my price policy? No,

502
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:29,540
I handle margins in my lookup table. So really being disciplined,

503
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,540
and thinking about it and what am I, what am I trying to attack?

504
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,540
How my price behaves or something that's influencing my margin or costs?

505
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,540
Lastly,

506
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,540
I've seen a lot of people adopt the lookup tables in the past, uh,

507
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,540
month since the first webinar. So that's encouraging to see.

508
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,540
And I've seen some customers take it to the next level and utilize to

509
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,540
look up tables within a single policy. As far as I'm aware,

510
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,540
there's no limit. You could.

511
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,540
Have five lookup tables referenced in a single pricing formula.

512
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,540
Well, what it's allowing them to do.

513
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,540
Is.

514
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,540
This yellow string of text returns a number. That's their margin.

515
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,540
This red string of text returns a number.

516
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,540
That's a additional commission or an overhead.

517
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,540
And again, this is dynamically adjusted.

518
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,540
Both of them are dynamically adjusted based on the skew.

519
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,540
And so they're handling a lot of complexity.

520
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,540
And I'm going to give you an example.

521
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,540
And then.

522
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,540
And then these are the two different modules.

523
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,540
And the two are dynamically adjusted based on the skew.

524
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,540
And so they're handling a lot of complexity.

525
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,540
Um, in a very simplified way.

526
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,540
With the lookup tables.

527
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,540
Focused on the margin, you know, this is my formula.

528
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,540
These things are impacting my margin.

529
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,540
And then the behavior of what do I do with those ranges is handled by

530
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,540
the policy.

531
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,540
Um, so my foot, my.

532
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,540
I encourage you to at least use the one lookup table.

533
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,740
really ponder on this question,

534
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,260
give that list to your CSM and we can help you achieve,

535
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,400
you know, multiple lookup tables within policy,

536
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:03,240
handling all those variables that impact margin.

537
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm gonna reiterate some key points that I have found

538
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,840
help people manage repricing in EVP

539
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,920
and in the e-commerce space, have clear objectives.

540
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,620
If your objective is to make more money,

541
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,720
that's incredibly hard to measure in terms of

542
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,440
I took an action that made me more money.

543
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,920
I can look at a chart and see that I've done that,

544
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,120
but you can't really attribute that to an action.

545
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,240
I encourage you to have clear objectives.

546
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,880
I wanna sell 20% more of Brand X in the next six months,

547
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,660
or I want to increase my profit margin

548
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,960
across on Amazon by X%.

549
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,480
These clear objectives will help you identify

550
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,740
more specific, actionable steps.

551
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,920
Versus something as grandiose as just win the buy box more.

552
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,280
Win the buy box more, how?

553
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,920
By seeking down, by using relative amount,

554
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,920
winning the buy box more isn't always the best objective,

555
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,280
but it's more specific than just get more sales.

556
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,100
So again, have clear objectives.

557
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,030
If you're having trouble segmenting your catalog

558
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,710
by the data that's present,

559
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,910
you can leverage a re-pricing class attribute

560
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,210
at a high level.

561
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,510
It's an attribute on the ETail record called re-pricing class.

562
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,990
And what I do is I have customers getting their feet wet

563
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:33,070
with re-pricing, go use the bulk update tool

564
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,430
or the catalog source tool

565
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,950
to add re-pricing class attribute group one,

566
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,350
group two, test group three,

567
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,910
and then leverage that attribute in the selection criteria

568
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,270
to get items in the specific policies.

569
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,190
One of the challenges people face is like,

570
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,350
what selection criteria do I use

571
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,950
to get things where I need them to be?

572
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,750
This kind of simplifies that problem.

573
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,110
So you can move forward and then kind of double back

574
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,630
and go, how can I get this to be more data-driven

575
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,190
versus a grouping that I manually create?

576
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,230
Again, avoid multiple price policies

577
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,350
that just change your margin, use the lookup tables.

578
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:20,470
The number one violation of this tenant

579
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,270
is people having a policy for cost range.

580
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,470
Historically, that's what you had to do,

581
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,790
but I would encourage you,

582
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,590
if that's what your setup looks like,

583
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,550
one of the first things you're gonna wanna focus on

584
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,510
is moving all of those into one policy

585
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,950
and using a lookup table to handle cost range.

586
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,990
But you may find that,

587
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:44,150
oh, I have six policies for these six different brands.

588
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:49,250
That can be one policy and then a lookup table.

589
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,090
Lastly, can't reiterate this enough,

590
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,570
leverage the repricing results screen.

591
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,650
You can see when you exited and entered the buy box,

592
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,970
so you know those price ranges.

593
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,370
You can see who you're competing against most often.

594
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,890
You can see which policy and item moved from and to,

595
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,850
so you can kind of assess the life cycle

596
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,530
and the behavior of your setup.

597
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,370
But simply looking at the SKU

598
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,250
and what price it's calculating

599
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,930
won't tell you the entire journey it's gone through.

600
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,890
Look at the repricing results screen,

601
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,250
get familiar with that.

602
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,490
And I've looked at it enough

603
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,810
and helped enough clients that I can look at that.

604
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,810
I can look at a SKU, I can look at several SKUs,

605
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,370
and I can see the journey it's taking

606
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,250
that just takes time and exposure using the screen.

607
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,610
So I encourage you to, every time you wanna go,

608
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,690
hey, what's going on with repricing, start there,

609
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,770
look up a SKU and get familiar

610
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,980
with what that information's telling you.

611
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,340
I think also remember that while pricing is important

612
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,660
for the reseller community to win the buy box,

613
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,300
it is not the only variable in the Amazon algorithm.

614
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,940
Latency is also very important.

615
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,820
How quickly can you get the product to somebody?

616
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,620
Somebody that's FBA and is gonna get it there in a day

617
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,740
or two is going to always beat somebody

618
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,540
at five or six days,

619
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,340
even if they're selling at a higher price.

620
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,500
Your ODR, your seller ranking is gonna make a difference.

621
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,140
So there's other factors in your business

622
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:32,900
you need to focus on to have these repricing strategies

623
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,820
have the greatest impact.

624
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,300
I think for any of our clients

625
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,300
that have some fantastic high velocity products

626
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,860
and they're not at FBA,

627
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,980
you might wanna think about that.

628
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,820
So-

629
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,180
Nick, if you can to reiterate,

630
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,300
this webinar went a bit more granular than the previous one,

631
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,020
but they're all purposed around getting you

632
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,500
some background knowledge so that you can start thinking

633
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,820
and then in turn engage with your CSM.

634
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,230
Again, going back,

635
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,990
what variables impact your margin?

636
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,270
If you come to your CSM with a list of things

637
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,470
that you've identified impacting your margin,

638
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,830
they're gonna be much better enabled

639
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,070
to help you set up lookup tables.

640
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:24,230
So these are, I'm encouraging you,

641
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,550
I'm trying to get you to think

642
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,990
so that when you meet with your CSM,

643
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,270
they can help you leverage all that content

644
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:34,170
you've generated from that brainstorming.

645
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,530
A few questions here, James.

646
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:45,490
Are there triggers for eBay and Walmart or just Amazon?

647
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,050
Triggers and controllers work on all channels.

648
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,570
Some channels have triggers that others don't.

649
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:58,570
For example, Amazon price event triggers only on Amazon,

650
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,050
but sales velocity, price events, timers,

651
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,970
those will work across all channels.

652
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,050
Okay.

653
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,130
Seek up, seek down, hold price will also work on all channels.

654
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,570
Also, if some of you have been holding your questions,

655
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,730
get them in here before I get done.

656
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,210
How often can I seek up and down?

657
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,970
That's a great question.

658
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,770
It's gonna really be dependent on a number of variables

659
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,210
that would have to be assessed,

660
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,890
such as catalog size,

661
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:35,740
the number of notifications we're dealing with from Amazon,

662
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,900
the banding on certain channels.

663
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,740
But at a high level, I typically seek every,

664
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,780
the quickest I try and seek is every 15 minutes.

665
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,220
You're not likely going to achieve seeking every minute

666
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,340
without very,

667
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:59,340
without setup that isolates and handles that very specifically.

668
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,740
And at that point, there's probably a better solution

669
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,740
than getting the repricing engine

670
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,860
to just look at that one skew.

671
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,380
You could achieve it in a different way.

672
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,580
But it's a good question.

673
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,700
It would have to be determined with your CSM on a call,

674
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,540
but-

675
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,180
I would imagine also depends on catalog size.

676
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,260
Yeah, I mean, that's gonna be the biggest variable

677
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,420
because how long does it take us to get to your catalog?

678
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,260
How many items are getting prioritized for repricing?

679
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,300
But, you know, the quickest increments

680
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,940
I typically recommend are between 15 and 30 minutes.

681
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,780
Okay.

682
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,460
Can I schedule policies?

683
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,760
Maybe I wanna raise my price in the evenings.

684
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,080
Yeah, so there's an indirect way to achieve that

685
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,520
with shipping policies.

686
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,920
You can have your selection criteria

687
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,640
within your repricing policies,

688
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,120
look at what shipping policy and items assigned to.

689
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,560
And shipping policies can be scheduled.

690
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,240
So I can have an item scheduled to move to a shipping policy.

691
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,520
I can have a very high priority rule

692
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,080
that says items in this shipping policy get assigned to it.

693
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,040
And then it would reprice with that rule

694
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,560
that the pricing policy schedule would expire

695
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,120
and I assume we would move it back.

696
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,800
And at that point,

697
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,480
the repricing policy assigned to it would change.

698
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,480
So you can achieve time scheduled repricing

699
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,600
with the usage of scheduling shipping policy assignment.

700
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,440
Okay.

701
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,800
Well, and here's one very similar to the statement

702
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,120
I made just a few minutes ago.

703
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Jen, if I'm selling an FBA and my competition is FBM,

704
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,840
can I raise my price or seek up with my price

705
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,560
and then wait till I lose the buy box

706
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,200
and then steal it right back?

707
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,360
So you would have, from understanding correctly,

708
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,040
you're in the buy box and the person competing is FBM?

709
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,360
Correct, and I'm FBA.

710
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,600
I have the prime batch.

711
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,200
So I could, you would have a policy

712
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,800
that detects you in the buy box, moves you to a seek up.

713
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,360
And that seek up, you have a trigger that's detecting

714
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,600
if you lose the buy box.

715
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,000
And if you lose, you move to a seek down

716
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,080
or a relative amount.

717
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:46,120
You could also have a, say it's in a price policy.

718
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,920
You could have a buy box status trigger

719
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,560
that says if buy box owner is FBA,

720
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,880
I wanna compete in a certain way

721
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,400
that gets your price going back up.

722
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,440
But yeah, you could achieve that.

723
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,160
Well, I only have a few minutes left.

724
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,960
What's the best way to segment my catalog?

725
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,760
Great question.

726
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,600
I think,

727
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,840
just to give some examples in the automotive space brand,

728
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,240
manufacturer, huge drivers in the home goods space,

729
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,840
it's more about what type of product it is.

730
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,040
I want all my curtains.

731
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,080
I want all my bathroom accessories.

732
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,640
I want all my space rugs.

733
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,560
So there isn't a one size fits all answer,

734
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,600
but I would encourage you looking at brands

735
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,800
is a segmentation factor.

736
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,320
Cost is obviously an obvious one,

737
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,560
but it's gonna be dependent on your space

738
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,240
and industry knowledge, really.

739
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,280
For example, I deal with a lot of customers

740
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,520
that sell light bulbs.

741
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,480
They're gonna know a lot.

742
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,640
They're gonna know better how to segment that than I would.

743
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,760
Do they have industrial light bulbs

744
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,540
and then commercial light bulbs?

745
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,730
I would engage with your CSM

746
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,610
so they can provide some input,

747
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,210
but it's really gonna be your industry knowledge

748
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,610
and your industry segment that's gonna drive that.

749
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:33,130
But again, two examples, automotive space,

750
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,090
it's really brand driving it.

751
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,930
And then in home goods, it's really the type of product.

752
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,010
Okay, here's a quick one.

753
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:46,950
Does UPP override MAP for re-pricing?

754
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,950
Great question.

755
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:54,230
MAP is actually more of just a stored data point in EVP.

756
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,590
If you want MAP to be leveraged

757
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:02,830
as a price influencing mechanism stored as UPP.

758
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,300
Oh, that's pretty simple.

759
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:12,300
The terms are synonymously used out in the marketplaces.

760
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,940
So what we chose to do is they serve the same function.

761
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,420
So again, MAP is just stored in EVP.

762
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,740
You can reference it, you can see it.

763
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,060
UPP is the one that's gonna drive price behavior,

764
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,440
prevent you from selling below that.

765
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,440
So if you're hyper aware or wanna be vigilant on UPP slash MAP,

766
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,220
always store it as a UPP.

767
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,060
Okay.

768
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,000
MAP has no influence on pricing.

769
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,060
I don't think we're gonna get to all of them today.

770
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,000
So any of them that I don't get to,

771
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,740
just email your CSM and or schedule a meeting

772
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,140
and bear with me, James,

773
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,580
this one is about a small paragraph.

774
00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:00,580
Is it possible to re-price an ASIN on Amazon

775
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:06,040
relative to the price of a completely different ASIN?

776
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,900
We have a product that we are the only seller.

777
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,780
So we always have the buy box

778
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,880
but we compete against a different ASIN.

779
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,840
We'd like to set our re-pricing to compete against

780
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,840
the buy box price of a different ASIN that we don't sell.

781
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,200
Is that possible?

782
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,650
So it's almost like two brands competing with each other.

783
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,010
Yeah, what I'm hearing is you wanna do

784
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,990
a skew level price parity.

785
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,350
I'm not aware of a way to achieve that today

786
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:46,090
but that would be an excellent feature request to explore.

787
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,510
What you're saying is I have two ASINs

788
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:52,130
and I want this one to be the price driver for both

789
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,050
because I'm alone on one of them.

790
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,210
Yeah, that's a very interesting scenario.

791
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,520
Just thinking through, yeah, I don't know

792
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,000
if that could be achieved today

793
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,400
but it would be something worth exploring

794
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,920
as a price parity enhancement.

795
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,920
Yeah, and we had some comments

796
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,860
from their other CSMs that are on the call,

797
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,480
a great product feature request.

798
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,680
So whoever brought that up,

799
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,520
sit with your CSM, figure out how to more fully define that

800
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,060
and we'll have Dev take a look at that.

801
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,280
All those other questions that you had out there,

802
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,240
I'm sorry, we're coming up on our time

803
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,440
and we wanna be respectful of your time.

804
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,280
I do wanna remind you, you can move to the next slide.

805
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,400
Our next session is gonna be in July.

806
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,080
It is gonna be July 12th,

807
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,240
a month from the second Wednesday of the month.

808
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,500
We will be sending out a survey again,

809
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,420
asking you for your input on three different topics

810
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,700
that we can talk about.

811
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,540
Hopefully you'll pick a topic

812
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,560
that we can give James a month off.

813
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,220
But I love doing these, we want you to attend.

814
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:30,020
Remember, this will be available in 24 to 48 hours

815
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:34,460
after the session is over in the Help Center,

816
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,220
in the Knowledge Center.

817
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,100
If you have any other questions

818
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,940
or wanna talk about this in more in depth,

819
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,440
please work with your CSM.

820
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,000
And I also wanna talk about some new offers coming up.

821
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:55,180
Several of you have already initiated something.

822
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,660
We're trying to take questions

823
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,900
and similar kind of thoughts from multiple clients

824
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,900
and develop packages that are more optimally priced

825
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,540
to make it easier for you to move forward.

826
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:16,540
There's less ambiguity and there's less unknowns.

827
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,820
You know what you're getting.

828
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,140
There's a known price

829
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,160
and you know how quickly you can expect to see results.

830
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,460
One of them that many of you are familiar with

831
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,940
is the eBay Accelerate Program.

832
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,560
We're taking this approach

833
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,260
from working with a couple other merchants

834
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,140
that do very well on eBay

835
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:41,100
and have very successful eBay programs.

836
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,380
And finding out those best practices and best approaches

837
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,340
to keep in their eBay program fresh and aligned

838
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,060
with their growth objectives.

839
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,300
And the major things that we've pulled out about of that

840
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,520
are things that like delisting and relisting

841
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,660
can have a major impact.

842
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,800
Understanding what it would take to get your account

843
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,260
into the eBay Top Seller Program

844
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,740
and trying to round out your user profile

845
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,300
along with re-pricing optimizations.

846
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,900
And one of these other merchants saw a 10% increase

847
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,260
and it's been for several months now

848
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,900
on their eBay program, monthly sales.

849
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,780
Now, let's be honest,

850
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,940
eBay is not necessarily a retirement account for most of you

851
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:35,940
but 10% is 10%, multiply it times 12, it's a real number.

852
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:42,400
A number of you already reviewing your re-pricing goals

853
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,980
with your CSM to be commended.

854
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:50,740
And those of you that have not reviewed your re-pricing goals

855
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,040
and looked at all your different policies

856
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,940
in the last 12 to 18 months, it's time.

857
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:01,060
Contact your CSM so we can take a quick review.

858
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,020
But once again, we wanna be packaging this up

859
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,460
into a simple offering.

860
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:12,300
We're working on actually doing several predefined policies

861
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,580
that can be added to your environment

862
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:20,180
and then tweet to meet your exact objectives.

863
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,080
So you'll be seeing some very,

864
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,140
the basics of any business

865
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,020
will be developed by some of our people.

866
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:35,220
And once again, we're seeing some people increase sales

867
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:40,040
15 to 25% by just taking a fresh new look

868
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,220
at how they're doing their pricing policies

869
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,020
and it's very doable.

870
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,780
And then stay tuned,

871
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:51,940
while we initiated the eBay Accelerate Program

872
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,380
around 30, 45 days ago,

873
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,780
we're starting to look at other marketplaces and saying,

874
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,260
how can we make our community more successful

875
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,900
on that marketplace?

876
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,900
And we'll work with one or two people

877
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,940
to figure out the best way to approach that.

878
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,080
Then we'll take those best practices to you, the community

879
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,100
and offer a very affordable program.

880
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:20,540
And I'm hearing rumblings, it's gonna be Walmart

881
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,380
and we'll share that with you.

882
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,280
And if that's something you wanna engage us on

883
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,300
to grow your Walmart business, we'd be happy to do so.

884
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,820
Thank you for attending.

885
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,060
I really enjoy doing this

886
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,060
because James has to do all the work.

887
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,300
I just get to do introductions

888
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:44,340
and I hope that you get some value each time we do this.

889
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,780
So thank you again.

890
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,340
Have a great summer.

891
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,500
We'll see you in July.

892
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,900
And if you have any further questions, once again,

893
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,380
we say it all the time,

894
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,460
just give James or Jason or someone at eBay a call.

895
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,480
We're gonna try and help you out.

896
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,320
Thank you.

897
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,460
Thank you.
