## Quick Steps

1. Here we are at the May edition of Tech Edge,.
2. About how it can apply to your environment specifically.
3. And available on the Help Center,.
4. So there's potential there to create it.
5. What does the market look like for this particular product set?
6. Again, I've brought up selection criteria.
7. If an item meets a certain set of conditions,.
8. If you create a restriction.
9. We're optimizing that feature set,.
10. You can create restrictions that affect multiple channels,.
11. Where I do and do not create listings.
12. But this item's restricted, so I'm not gonna create it.
13. Should I restrict it at the time of importing.
14. Or filter it out or do it with dynamic restrictions?
15. When I create the supplier record,.
16. Should I just filter those out and not create them at all?
17. To prevent those listings from being created.
18. That after seven days, a listing starts to get suppressed.
19. That they suppress it.
20. Is you set various parameters.
21. Is it creates automated behavior based on order conditions.
22. It's its own type of selection criteria.
23. I can filter on all orders that have that tag.
24. So I can filter on those orders.
25. Any order with expedited shipping,.
26. And work with your CSM to set up order action rules.
27. And optimized filtering on the sales results screen.
28. And they can work towards setting up.
29. Do I kit and bundle them and create a new ASIN?
30. About what pricing strategies you want to apply.
31. But this is definitely a filter you should utilize.
32. And more importantly,.
33. One usage of this filter client identified the listings.
34. I need to apply this strategy.
35. Or apply a creative strategy.
36. Because you can create your own ASIN off of that.
37. But it is very important to be aware of what it can do.
38. The bulk updater is a listing management tool.
39. I select all my Amazon listings, check restriction.
40. One activity I always encourage is isolate items and error.
41. Bulk update through existing bulk update force publication.
42. And see if any of the error message return.
43. A lot of times those error messages just go away.
44. And then you can isolate the reoccurring error messages.
45. This can be good for new listings that you've just created.
46. So again, the bulk update tool has a lot of potential.
47. Export the sales listing screen,.
48. Import it with the catalog source.
49. With the bulk update, saving them some time.
50. You should also be aware you can update attribute values.
51. With the bulk update tool for multiple listings.
52. I can select the listings on the screen.
53. And do a bulk update.
54. Number seven is attribute and category mapping.
55. Attribute and category mapping allows you.
56. This can also apply to categories.
57. Go up to this category mapping tool and it allows you to say,.
58. You can find a pattern of common ones, color, size, type,.
59. Find a source for that data, map it to eBay,.
60. And that addresses that error and prevents it from occurring.
61. Or I know that a distribution center.
62. And these expedited orders need to ship.
63. So I select them, find the next best solution.
64. Select the orders I can't handle,.
65. So when you open a skew.
66. And you go to master skew details page.
67. And then slowly select from the best source available.
68. This is important to have in place.
69. It's important to have in place.
70. I have these set of boxes, they cost me this much.
71. That situation where it created two boxes,.
72. It gives you listing errors, it gives you task errors,.
73. To work with your CSM and isolate important errors.
74. That causes a very specific error that we track.
75. We will create an issue,.
76. And orders are failing to send or import,.
77. That's an error message we can track for.
78. So again, an issue is looking for a specific error message.
79. We have some customers setting up their own monitors,.
80. Why don't we go to the next one?
