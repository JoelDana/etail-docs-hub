1
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:17,230
Well, thank you for those of you joining us on our second maiden voyage of Tech Edge.

2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,390
Here it is, April already, and we want to thank you for attending.

3
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:28,790
We are going to be a very prompt group for this webinar from here on forward, and we're

4
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,270
going to kick it off now.

5
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,270
So thank you for attending.

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:41,190
Today, we're going to be talking about pricing, or if I screw up badly, how quickly I can

7
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,710
go out of business.

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:51,310
We're going to be focusing on the basics of the ETail pricing and repricing module with

9
00:00:51,310 --> 00:01:00,710
over 100 million Prime users out there today, always on the hunt for a bargain.

10
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:11,070
Even the slightest mistake in pricing can be disastrous for many merchants and sellers.

11
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,070
So today, we're not going to go to the next slide yet, but James and I are going to be

12
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,510
once again your host.

13
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,790
Thank you for attending.

14
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:27,070
We're going to be going through why you want or need to reprice in the e-commerce sphere

15
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,710
of influence.

16
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,990
Why is this important?

17
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,310
This is as important as any module we have.

18
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:41,670
James is going to go through the actual, let's break this apart into basic steps that we

19
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,830
can walk through for any of those that are not super familiar with our pricing module.

20
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:58,350
From there, we'll talk about some practical applications of it and some already existing

21
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,430
ways to put this into your business environment immediately.

22
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:09,030
Then we'll get into the question and answer session, and those can come up starting almost

23
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:16,510
now, and when appropriate, I will ask them during that section of the webinar, otherwise

24
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:22,150
we'll leave them towards the end, and then we'll talk a little bit about next month

25
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,790
and what's going on in Tech Edge.

26
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,750
The one thing I do want to remind you right here and now is there will be a survey at

27
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,750
the end.

28
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,230
We would love to get your feedback.

29
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,790
Also you get a survey quarterly for me, Tal.

30
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,470
Please fill that out.

31
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,470
You may have filled that out in the past, but we still want to see you do it every month

32
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,150
to see if we're improving or if we're not.

33
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:58,190
Also while we already have our session picked out for next month, it's going to be your

34
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:08,380
chance to give us some feedback on where you would like us to go.

35
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,100
E-commerce is not just about revenue.

36
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,500
It's not just about whether you win or lose the buy box.

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,540
It's also about protecting your margins.

38
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,300
For those of you that are golfers, you may be familiar with the slogan, you drive for

39
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,580
show but putt for dough.

40
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:41,220
In e-commerce is revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, and cash is king.

41
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,700
It's all about making sure that we're profitable.

42
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,100
I'll be your host again, and I'm happy to be here with you, and then I have with

43
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:57,980
me my partner, James Davis, our subject matter expert, and some of yours, a customer success

44
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:05,380
manager from ETL, and he's going to be taking you through the rest of today.

45
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,620
But always, always, always.

46
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,860
Please questions, questions, questions.

47
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,740
If we're not answering your questions, we're not sure that we're giving you the right

48
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:23,420
information, and our one primary goal here is to help you get better.

49
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,340
So with that, let's get started.

50
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,540
We're always going to remind you, why are we here?

51
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,980
It really is.

52
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:40,340
It isn't about tickets, yes, it's about tickets, but did we help you grow this month?

53
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,820
Did we help you get more profitable this month?

54
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:48,220
I know we've helped several of our clients by going through and saying, we're selling

55
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:54,940
a lot, are we optimized for profitability, and we've had some great results recently.

56
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,060
Ask your CSM about those kind of working with us.

57
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:05,580
And James, now it's you.

58
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,380
As Jeff mentioned, the first topic we're really going to dive into is how to think about re-pricing

59
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,020
in the e-commerce space.

60
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,340
What are the things to be thinking about as you're strategizing at a high level before you

61
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,820
get into the weeds of policies and lookup tables?

62
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,460
So the first thing you want to think about is, am I competing on a competitive marketplace

63
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,280
where there's other sellers, marketplaces like Amazon or Walmart, where you're not the

64
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,880
only seller on that listing, and you're all competing for some version of a buy place?

65
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,420
Or are you re-pricing on an independent marketplace like eBay or Shopify where you don't have other

66
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:54,520
competitors that the buyer can kind of compare around and other competitors that drive price

67
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
changes?

68
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,880
So that's a very high level thing to consider when you're approaching, how do I re-price?

69
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,320
What type of marketplace are you on?

70
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,340
The next most important thing to think about and understand is, what is your business's

71
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,340
competitive differentiator that allows you to get an edge on re-pricing?

72
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,680
If you're a reseller and there's 12 other people selling the same product, how do you

73
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,460
get a competitive differentiator?

74
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:27,380
It could be latency, it could be your seller ring, it could be your ability to get inventory

75
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,800
at a premium cost that allows you to have a lower floor than your competitors while

76
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,100
still making a healthy margin.

77
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,660
But really understanding what allows you to be set apart from the rest.

78
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,700
Do you have an exclusive brand deal so you're the only person who should be selling?

79
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,740
There's a lot of different ways you can get a competitive differentiator, but you want

80
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:57,740
to understand what you have in your toolkit to give you a competitive edge.

81
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,260
And those are going to be very specific to what your business can achieve with your

82
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:09,110
relationships with your suppliers, your manufacturers, and so forth.

83
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:14,350
The next variable to really consider because it feeds directly into re-pricing is shipping

84
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,950
cost and latency.

85
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,750
Do you have accurate weight or dim data?

86
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,810
Are your shipping cost estimates as accurate as possible?

87
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:31,750
Is your latency as accurate as possible because latency is going to drive your appeal to buyers.

88
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,950
Obviously if it's a great price, but I have to wait a month, I'm not interested because

89
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,550
if I'm on e-commerce, I want it now, I want it in two days.

90
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,070
And then with shipping cost, the more accurate you can generate an estimated shipping cost,

91
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:51,990
the better you can get at squeezing your margin, maximizing your margin, knowing where

92
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,370
your profit potential is.

93
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,910
Shipping cost is driven off of weight data and dim data.

94
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,830
Dim data is always preferred because a lot of carriers will use dim weight over flat weight.

95
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,390
And again, that lets you get to a more accurate estimated shipping cost.

96
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,630
James, we already have our first question.

97
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,230
What are some of the ways to improve the accuracy of my shipping costs?

98
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,710
Can I get my shipping costs from my carriers?

99
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:27,190
So there's two general approaches to getting an accurate shipping cost.

100
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:34,110
The ideal method is to get your shipping rates from your carriers.

101
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,350
You can typically reach out to your rep and they'll send you an Excel spreadsheet which

102
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:44,670
has all of your negotiated rates and replicating those in EVP as shipping cost models.

103
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,190
There is some documentation on the Help Center about shipping cost models that you can reference,

104
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:56,470
but you're essentially replicating your fulfillment costs in shipping cost models that can then

105
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,630
be leveraged for estimated shipping.

106
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:05,510
The secondary method which is also utilized but slightly less ideal is to use a blended

107
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,010
rate table.

108
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,030
Look at your average shipping costs.

109
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:16,850
Generate a blended rate table that you know puts you above a minimum threshold.

110
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:24,110
The disadvantage of a blended rate table is, again, you're estimating on top of estimates

111
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,950
instead of replicating the actual costs with your rate tables.

112
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,390
But putting some time and effort into understanding your shipping cost model setup would be a

113
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,750
way to get more accurate shipping costs.

114
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,750
Great.

115
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,750
Thank you.

116
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:45,550
Also, if you're leveraging the native shipping workflow in EVP, we capture DIM data during

117
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,630
shipping label manifesting which can help you get accurate DIM data into the system.

118
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:57,650
Because you're leveraging supplier data which isn't as good as, hey, I put it in a box and

119
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,050
shipped it and this is how big it was, you know, that might be a slightly different than

120
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,550
what your supplier says.

121
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:08,530
So capturing that data in that way is also very effective.

122
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:15,710
The next piece of advice I give a lot of my clients is you are the masters of your

123
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,710
catalog.

124
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,290
I as a CSM can get to know your catalog, but you're going to have the most intimate

125
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,110
relationship with it.

126
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,070
You want to be able to look at your catalog at a macro level in terms of large category

127
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,110
sets.

128
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:34,410
For example, this break kits can come in the range of 1,000 SKUs.

129
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,650
It's more prudent to tackle those at a macro level.

130
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:45,910
How do I want all of these repricing versus going how does an individual break kit

131
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,290
reprice?

132
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,130
On the flip side, I may want to look at my top 20 selling items and really focus

133
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,490
individually on those SKUs and their repricing behavior.

134
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,730
But if I have 10,000 SKUs, I can't focus individually on each one.

135
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,570
So you need to be able to understand where it makes sense to slice and dice your

136
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:10,710
catalog in terms of large groups, individual SKUs, and sort of small subsets of

137
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,110
high volume SKUs.

138
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:19,850
So it really is a precursor to effective repricing is knowing where it makes sense

139
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,170
to slice and dice your catalog.

140
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:28,110
In the out of motive space, spark plugs, you typically need to be isolated

141
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,490
because of repricing nuances.

142
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,450
But there are many ways to understand the catalog and you will

143
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,170
understand it best, but you want to think about where do I need to isolate

144
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:44,030
items because they're very competitive and they're high volume and I need their

145
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:50,150
own repricing structure versus well, I can put these 25,000 items and look at

146
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:57,990
them at a macro level because they're slower volume, they are UPP price and

147
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,550
force, so there's not much options in terms of behavior, things like that.

148
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,710
But really understanding where it makes sense to group your catalog is

149
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,710
very important.

150
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:16,270
The trap many people call them to is I'm going to focus on individual SKUs only and

151
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,070
they never back up into the macro level.

152
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:26,070
And these are all great topics to go over with your CSM and go, how would you break

153
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,990
up my catalog?

154
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:35,830
How do I identify those top selling products, whether it's the top 20 or the top 5 or 10%?

155
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,430
Let's go in and take a look at your catalog together and find those areas where we can

156
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,270
have the biggest impact on your business.

157
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:51,030
You have a lot of reports available to identify that information, but it's important to have

158
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:59,450
an idea of those nuances as you're going into what am I doing with repricing.

159
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,090
Having business objectives is a really good goal.

160
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,490
Oftentimes I ask clients what the results they are looking for and they say I want

161
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,570
to win the buy box.

162
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,570
While that is a business objective, it's very generic and hard to sort of measure success

163
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,570
again.

164
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:19,530
So you can look at your buy box percent, but I encourage people to go, I want to sell 10%

165
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,690
more of this product category this month than last month.

166
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:32,930
Or I want to generate sales via having products on a discount to see the, you know, maybe

167
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,010
I sell it at a lower margin, but I'm selling more of it.

168
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:42,490
So I end up with a higher total profit, but having a defined business objective that can

169
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:48,530
be a measure of success is good and getting away from the obsession of the buy box.

170
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:54,650
It's important to win the buy box, but you want to apply strategies in such a way that

171
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,930
the outcome isn't just you're in the buy box because you can have the buy box and

172
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,010
not make sales just as easily as you can have the buy box and make sales.

173
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:09,890
So defining your business objective is a good place to start at the beginning of this process.

174
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,370
You can win the buy box and lose money.

175
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,570
Yes, you can win the buy box and lose money and that's, you know, another good example

176
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:23,110
of what's your objective really is selling more of this product, improving your margin

177
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:30,670
on this product and increasing volume of a certain subset of products.

178
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,150
The next thing I encourage customers to do, your clients to do is to always be monitoring

179
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,950
the competition.

180
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,510
There's a million different repricers out there, but they're all based on the same

181
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,670
technology and what you will find is you'll apply a strategy.

182
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:50,210
It may drive sales up for a week, a month, a quarter, but at some point your competitors

183
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:56,690
repricer will capture what you're doing and apply a counter strategy.

184
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,410
And so it's never good to set up strategies in Q1 and forget about them.

185
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:07,210
It requires constant monitoring and analysis and making adjustments.

186
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:12,850
And so looking at what your competitors are doing can help you understand where those

187
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,690
adjustments may need to occur.

188
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:27,950
But again, it's important to understand what the competition is doing to your price and

189
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:36,510
whether it's important to respond to their price events or maybe you want to ignore them

190
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,990
because they're just manipulating your price, but you have to kind of understand what they're

191
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,990
doing.

192
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,270
And then again, analyzing and adjusting.

193
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:50,070
I always making a change to repricing, giving it two to three weeks to see the behavior and

194
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,070
then making adjustments.

195
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,430
But you want to constantly be reviewing and adjusting and I'll show you how you can do

196
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,110
that effectively shortly.

197
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,990
But again, these are the high level mindsets and considerations you should have as you

198
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,470
approach repricing and e-commerce.

199
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,190
So the repricing basics and EVP.

200
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:15,430
The very first thing you're going to start with is selection criteria.

201
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,350
Then there's some basic configuration that must be in place to allow automatic repricing

202
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,230
to occur.

203
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:28,230
Go over what a pricing formula is and what its functions are and some of the options you

204
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,310
have there.

205
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:36,710
Some basic price policy configuration options that can affect behavior.

206
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,550
Then I'll discuss controllers and triggers and their functions.

207
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:47,110
AppTables is a currently under leveraged feature, which I will explain how it works in tandem

208
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:55,950
with pricing formula to achieve a lot of complexity and nuance in a very simple structure.

209
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,710
And lastly, I will discuss the repricing result screen, which needs to be leveraged

210
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:04,900
to do that analysis and adjustment.

211
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,060
So selection criteria is used in various parts of the system in EVP, but what it is is it's

212
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,700
a logic statement that defines a group of SKUs.

213
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,860
And the reason it's important to have a grasp on how selection criteria can work and how

214
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,980
simple or nuanced it can get is because many times a client will approach me and say,

215
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,780
I want these items to reprice them this way.

216
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,460
And the first question I ask is, how do I identify those items systematically with

217
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,300
selection criteria?

218
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,240
I can obviously go through 10,000 SKUs and assign them manually, but that is ineffective.

219
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,960
So you need to be able to identify groups of SKUs with selection criteria.

220
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,440
This example on the screen is very simple.

221
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,280
It's just saying an Amazon record exists.

222
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,200
I match that criteria if that's true.

223
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,240
But I can get as nuanced as it weighs greater than a certain amount, has a certain manufacturer

224
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,900
and a certain supplier record is present.

225
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,960
So your ability to nuance selection criteria defines your ability to nuance your pricing

226
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
policies.

227
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,920
It's important to familiarize yourselves with the options available.

228
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,000
I encourage you to present a scenario and then work with your CSM to get the selection

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,960
criteria correct.

230
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,280
But knowing the selection criteria limitations will help you from kind of putting out, oh,

231
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,240
I want to identify the items in this way.

232
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,840
It's not possible because selection criteria doesn't have that function.

233
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,300
So knowing the functions of selection criteria is important.

234
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:43,180
And then what selection criteria will do will automatically assign items to enabled policies.

235
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,580
So this checkbox is here.

236
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,540
It's also up in the corner over here on the full screen.

237
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,300
But if this box is checked and the other configuration options that I'll mention a

238
00:18:52,300 --> 00:19:00,270
second there, we will use this selection criteria to assign an item to the policy.

239
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:05,870
So to allow automatic repricing, the following conditions must be true.

240
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,550
Automatic pricing must be enabled on the SKU.

241
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,710
That's right here.

242
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,730
This is enabled by default.

243
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,110
You can manipulate and adjust this using the bulk updater on the sales channel screen.

244
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,270
So if you want to disable a group of listings or enable a group of listings, you can do

245
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,710
it in bulk.

246
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,550
You don't have to go through individually.

247
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,310
A pricing policy with matching selection criteria must be enabled.

248
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,310
Again, the selection criteria is used to automatically assign an item.

249
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:39,190
So if it can't be assigned, then it can't be associated to a policy to use.

250
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,630
Most people will find they'll click reprice.

251
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,570
It'll say no matching price policy.

252
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:49,790
That means you don't have a selection criteria option that would meet that specific SKU.

253
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,270
So that's an important thing to have in place.

254
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,870
An item must have publishable inventory.

255
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:03,470
This is also important to know if there's no inventory to publish, then the system cannot

256
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,150
reprice due to the way the logic and EDP works and how the system kind of estimates

257
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,670
shipping and exposes inventory.

258
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:18,590
So it's important to make sure you have some exposed inventory if you are looking for repricing

259
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,730
to occur.

260
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,610
And then an item must have weight and or DIM data.

261
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,830
This is because a shipping cost has to be generated.

262
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,550
Technically you could have a shipping override as well.

263
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,310
But obviously the ideal is to have DIM data.

264
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,750
So DIM weight can be calculated and you can have the most accurate shipping costs.

265
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,230
And as I mentioned before, the more accurate your shipping cost, the more accurate and

266
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,150
tighter your margins can get.

267
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:50,910
James, it seems like while as robust and powerful as this is, if you just take a very structured

268
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:57,390
approach to it, you just can kind of follow the steps.

269
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:03,030
You know, clearly talk to your CSM, but it's pretty logical things that it's asking

270
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,030
for.

271
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,030
Yeah.

272
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,270
Then again, what I'm covering in this slide are the pillars.

273
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:13,870
Once you have a grasp of these concepts, you have background knowledge to engage in a meaningful

274
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,040
conversation with your CSM.

275
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Yeah.

276
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,900
And I've talked to some of our clients that early on, they didn't have all their weight,

277
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,720
so they just threw some numbers in during implementation.

278
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,840
And you really do need to go back and check those and get good data in those selections.

279
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Yeah.

280
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Cash is king, but so is data.

281
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
There you go.

282
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,040
You want up to me.

283
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,640
Pricing formula, conceptually very basic.

284
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,240
Your floor and ceiling set the upper and lower price ranges and your target sets your

285
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,200
ideal price range.

286
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,640
Target is used on independent marketplaces like Shopify and eBay as a starting price.

287
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
I start there.

288
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,120
And then I may have mechanisms, which I'll cover in a sec, that drive the price up or

289
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,400
down, and I will never go below my floor above my ceiling.

290
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,680
Target is also used on competitive marketplaces like Amazon if you're the only person on

291
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
the ASIN.

292
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,120
If you're alone on an ASIN, we'll start at your target.

293
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,320
And then again, there may be functions that drive the price up or down.

294
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,360
Pricing policies utilize tokens.

295
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,080
Be familiar with the tokens available.

296
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,880
P tokens are dynamically looking up that variable for that skew at that specific

297
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,560
point in time, returning it to the formula and then doing the calculation.

298
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,680
So again, if I don't have accurate shipping cost estimates, I'm not going to be able

299
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,080
to have an accurate margin.

300
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,480
So that's why getting your shipping cost as accurate as possible is very important.

301
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,680
You know, and again, item cost, we'll look at the supplier channel or the

302
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,400
ETL channel that has the inventory exposed at that time, based on all of your

303
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,080
priorities, configuration for each location.

304
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,880
And again, that can be a big competitive differentiator is that I get the items at

305
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,800
a better cost.

306
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,080
Therefore, I can have a lower floor.

307
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,600
I can have a better price.

308
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,890
I can get more sales.

309
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,770
But each policy will have its own set of pricing formula, and they will all

310
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:28,140
utilize tokens and then basic order operation and math functions.

311
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:35,060
Some basic price policy configuration options to be aware of an EVP.

312
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,780
First, relative amount.

313
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:43,340
I'll cover seeking in a moment, but your two options for adjusting your price in a

314
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,020
competitive way are relative amount or you seek.

315
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,100
A relative amount is used on a collective marketplace.

316
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,420
And because there's other sellers, we can look at and make a price adjustment

317
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,900
based on their price.

318
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,420
So a relative amount on an Amazon price policy looks like this here.

319
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:07,060
And I can reprice by an amount or a percent based on the type of seller.

320
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,020
So if I'm competing against Amazon, I may want to just adjust by a penny because

321
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,300
Amazon's biased and will give themself the buy box.

322
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,340
But if I'm competing against a merchant, I may want to beat them by 10 cents

323
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,900
because I know that that range will kick them out of the buy box and give it to

324
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,860
me and then FBA.

325
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:31,500
Similar understanding the nuance of your FBA competition will let you know,

326
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,460
should I adjust by a lot, a little?

327
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:40,060
Should I maybe I price above FBA because my latency is better and that could be a

328
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,740
way to win the buy box.

329
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
And then this one down here is Walmart.

330
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,540
We have less information provided by Walmart, but we can still adjust the

331
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,660
price by a relative amount.

332
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,900
An important thing to understand here is if these numbers are positive,

333
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,660
I will adjust above.

334
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,860
So if I want to adjust below, I need to make sure these numbers are negative.

335
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,340
If they are at zero, then we match the price that the competitors have.

336
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,380
The second repricing configuration option that is available and you should be

337
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,420
aware of is price parity.

338
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,340
Simply put, price parity is where we copy the price on one channel and put it on another.

339
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,180
You can copy it and adjust it by an amount.

340
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,540
This has been used historically to allow marketplaces with competition to help

341
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:31,220
drive the price on marketplaces without competition.

342
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,620
For example, eBay has competitors, so the price is adjusting all the time.

343
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,340
eBay doesn't.

344
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:46,240
So I may have my eBay price be driven by what's occurring on Amazon.

345
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,520
And then within price policies, you'll see options to ignore price

346
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,600
parity if needed, but the general idea being that one marketplace doesn't have

347
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,400
price drivers and the other does.

348
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,480
And just like last month, all this information is going to be available so

349
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,920
that you can rewatch the webinar here.

350
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:14,920
You'll be able to go through the PowerPoints and James has prepared some

351
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:21,600
really good documentation that goes into these in a little bit greater depth to

352
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,680
partner with the digital assets that we are providing.

353
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,640
So I encourage you to rewatch this and then review the material.

354
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,120
As I did last time, I put out a series of questions that you should be able to

355
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,440
answer after reviewing the material and answering the questions demonstrates you

356
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,640
have the knowledge to understand the basics.

357
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,640
So you can A, take a stab at it yourself and B, independent self-enabled and B,

358
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,800
engage in a conversation with your CSM where they're not having to kind of go,

359
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,520
well, we can't achieve that in that way.

360
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,400
You need to ask it in a different way.

361
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,520
So one of the first more advanced functions of a pricing policy are controllers and triggers.

362
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,840
They're available on each policy on all channels.

363
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,120
A controller is a behavior.

364
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,480
So I want the price to behave in a certain way.

365
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,880
There are two options that are readily available and utilized.

366
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,880
One is seek, as I mentioned, you can either use a relative amount to adjust your

367
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,800
price based on what the other sellers are doing, or I can seek, which is simply

368
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,360
adjusting by an amount up or down over a fixed period of time.

369
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,160
Steep can be used on a marketplace like eBay where you don't have a price

370
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,760
driver, so I'm just seeking down until I start seeing sales or I'm seeking up

371
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,760
until my sales fall below a certain threshold.

372
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,320
The second controller option is hold, pretty self-explanatory.

373
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,400
If a policy has the hold controller set up, we hold that price.

374
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,920
I'll explain a bit more about some pricing policy loops that utilize that,

375
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,040
but essentially it's most heavily used when you want to hold a price such as

376
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:14,800
I've won the buy box, hold that price until I lose the buy box or an items on a

377
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,320
promotional, so I want it to hold the price so I get items into a policy and

378
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,440
then it just holds the price.

379
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,640
On top of controllers, we have triggers.

380
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,400
Triggers are a marketplace or price event.

381
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:37,800
Something happens on the marketplace or something happens in the EVP

382
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,480
that triggers a response, so a very obvious one is I win the buy box.

383
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:50,190
If I win the buy box, I want something to happen to the SKU in terms of how it's pricing.

384
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:56,950
The function of a trigger is that event occurs and the item is moved to a new policy,

385
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:03,150
so the idea being that if I'm seeking down for five hours, or in this case,

386
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:08,470
12 hours, I then want to move it to a new rule because if I haven't won the buy box

387
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:11,630
after seeking down for 12 hours, I want to apply a different strategy.

388
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,710
Maybe I use relative amount after that period of time, so it allows you to move items

389
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,550
in between different rules as these marketplace events occur,

390
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,670
and then in tandem with controllers, which affect price.

391
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,630
Couples look really interesting, James.

392
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,670
I like the idea of stock age.

393
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:38,190
If I've had something for 45, 60 days and I'm not seeing any movement on it

394
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,230
and I'm trying to manage 10,000 or 100,000 SKUs,

395
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:50,310
just let the system start pricing that so that I actually free up some inventory and capital.

396
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:55,230
Yeah, I'll cover it in a sec, but we've seen results with a FBA stock age loop,

397
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,430
so as your FBA inventory gets older, you offer it at a better price,

398
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:03,430
and that's been effective at selling the inventory as it ages.

399
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:08,270
Sales velocity is a big one, which I'll cover.

400
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,710
But again, being familiar with these options and what they do allows you to engage

401
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,750
in a meaningful conversation with the CSM and also enables you to kind of know,

402
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,350
this is what the system can do for me, and this is what it can't.

403
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:29,310
And so you apply strategies that are enforceable versus coming up with ideas

404
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,390
that you struggle to implement.

405
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,630
Two important notes about triggers.

406
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,590
Triggers can move items to policies that are not enabled.

407
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,990
So if you remember on the slide before, I said selection criteria is used

408
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,910
to assign items to policies that are enabled.

409
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,470
A policy can not have that checkbox and still be utilized,

410
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:54,470
but what that typically indicates is a trigger is moving a SKU to that policy

411
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,350
after it's been assigned via selection criteria.

412
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:02,550
So I have a default policy that captures the SKU selection criteria,

413
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,950
and then I have a trigger event which moves it to a policy that's not enabled.

414
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:11,510
So when you're looking at your repricing policies, don't necessarily think

415
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,750
because that checkbox is not there, it means the rule doesn't be used.

416
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:20,430
It could be that SKUs only get there because a trigger moved it there.

417
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:24,710
The second thing to understand and know is a trigger can move a SKU

418
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,150
to a policy with no formula.

419
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:32,830
In this scenario, the formula from the policy it moved from are inherited,

420
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,390
and this can be used in a number of ways.

421
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:44,270
But the main one is I define my floor, ceiling, and target within my default policy,

422
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:49,190
and then I may have a secondary default policy for a subcategory of products,

423
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,830
defining their floor, target, and ceiling.

424
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:56,750
Both those rules have triggers which move items into a SQL.

425
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:03,070
Now, the SQL doesn't have formula, so it doesn't redefine the target floor and ceiling,

426
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,190
and you don't need two different SQLs with formula

427
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,310
because they're being inherited as their move.

428
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:15,310
And again, work with your CSM, they can demonstrate this in some working examples,

429
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,230
but it is important to note, I have many people ask,

430
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,830
oh, that policy doesn't have formula, is it not working?

431
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,550
That may not be the case.

432
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:33,560
It may be that the expectation is the formula is inherited as the items move by a trigger.

433
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,720
Also, Ramon, remind everyone, keep those questions coming in

434
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,120
so that we have a very lively question and answer session at the end of this.

435
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:52,760
The lookup tables are the newest function that's been added to the repricing toolkit,

436
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,520
and it's utilized to determine your margin.

437
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,960
Historically, we found people setting up 20 different policies,

438
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,320
and the only reason they had 20 policies is they had some factor impacting the margin ranges,

439
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,880
oftentimes cost.

440
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,960
So you'd have a zero through 10 rule and a 10 through 15 and a 15 through 20 and 20.

441
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,000
And it was very difficult to manage 50 different rules for different cost ranges.

442
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:30,760
So we added lookup tables as a way to dynamically calculate margin based on SKU conditions.

443
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,440
So as you can see here in this formula, the margin is 0.9.

444
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,560
So I'm always going to calculate a 10% margin.

445
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,440
But as many of you know, I don't always need a 10% margin.

446
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,360
Sometimes I can get five, sometimes I need 20.

447
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:52,520
There's conditions around a SKU that kind of impact what margin is appropriate.

448
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,880
And so you can see in this formula, instead of having to fix number,

449
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,960
I have this big long string of text.

450
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,920
And all this is doing is telling the formula to look at a lookup table,

451
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,720
in this case, the margin floor table,

452
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,280
and then use the item cost to return a number.

453
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:17,120
So it allows you, again, to dynamically adjust your margin within a single price policy.

454
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:26,200
And this helps you have a simple pricing policy structure that's focused on behavior and response to events.

455
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:34,980
And then you let lookup tables handle all of the nuances of this impacts margin and that impacts margin.

456
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:41,340
So you first start off at a table, as I showed before, the table is defined in the formula.

457
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,540
So here I go to the floor margin.

458
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,260
I then look at a dimension.

459
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,060
Dimension is selection criteria.

460
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,220
Again, I emphasize this is why it's really important to know how selection criteria works

461
00:34:54,220 --> 00:35:01,060
and what's capable and what's not capable of selection criteria.

462
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,220
Because in here is a very simple example.

463
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:09,420
I'm just looking at, am I selling it from my stock or am I selling it from my stock?

464
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:17,220
And then I'm able to return two different margin values depending on which condition is true.

465
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,060
The value column, I have a bigger screenshot of this slide, so you'll see it in a sec.

466
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,060
But this column says value.

467
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,860
This is the cost of the item.

468
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,460
This column is amount.

469
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:34,140
This will be the number returned to the formula based on which dimension path we went down

470
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,900
and based on what the cost of the item is at the time of repricing.

471
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,460
So again, we start with a table.

472
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,700
We identify which dimension the skew would match.

473
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,620
Again, this is all selection criteria based.

474
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,540
Then we return an amount based on a value.

475
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:57,700
And again, the goal here is that the factors and nuances that impact your margin are handled

476
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:06,180
in lookup tables so that your pricing policies can be, the number of pricing policy you need is reduced

477
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:12,180
and they're focused on price behavior and response to marketplace events rather than

478
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:19,450
handling margin, price behavior, and response to marketplace events.

479
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:24,370
So just to recap, you have a pricing policy that either is using controllers and triggers

480
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:29,250
relative amount of price parity to handle the behavior of your price on the marketplace.

481
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:34,650
And then you use lookup tables to dynamically adjust your margin within a price policy.

482
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:41,250
And when you have this set up and all the facets are working together, you have a really

483
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:48,570
powerful repricing toolkit that, while it might not seem simple at first, once you understand

484
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,810
each piece, it makes a lot of sense and it will click and you will go, oh, I need to

485
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,810
adjust my margin.

486
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:57,850
I'm going to my lookup table and I need to adjust my margin for stock, so I'm going

487
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,770
to go to the stock dimension and adjust those numbers.

488
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:08,450
Oh, I need to, I want to get more competitive with the rate I seek down.

489
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:13,810
Oh, I'm going to my price policy and adjusting my controller and setting the rate to be faster

490
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:19,370
or adding a policy that has a trigger that moves it and I have seek rate fast and seek

491
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,010
rate slow.

492
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:28,930
But again, you want to handle behavior and response in the price policy and the nuances

493
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,370
of margin and lookup tables.

494
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:39,730
And James, I think these webinars do a great job of highlighting, showcasing some of the

495
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:45,850
changes we've made to the software that maybe not all our clients are aware of and how

496
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:52,410
they can use it, a positive impact on their business to drive the revenue while still

497
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,810
protecting the margins.

498
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,370
Listen again, my goal here is to give you the knowledge to engage in a conversation while

499
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,850
also being, you know, self-sufficient with repricing.

500
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:08,210
There's no reason you can't be in control of your own destiny when it comes to repricing

501
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,210
an EVP.

502
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:17,090
I'm going to go through this last slide relatively quickly, but oftentimes what I find is people

503
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:22,090
are looking at the repricing results on the SKU and they're on the repricing tab of

504
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,090
the SKU.

505
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:27,610
This gives you very basic details and I don't encourage using that screen except to maybe

506
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,610
check a price.

507
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:33,290
You should train yourself to use the repricing results screen to understand repricing results

508
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,770
and do that analysis and adjust.

509
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:42,090
A pro tip to make that more efficient for you is to select a channel.

510
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:46,290
Each repricing results screen is channel dependent.

511
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:52,170
Set up filters and columns that make sense for analyzing a broad group of items or a

512
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,890
specific group of items on sale or items within a certain policy and then save those

513
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:01,690
views so that you can reference them later, that other team members can look at them and

514
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,610
not have to recreate your views.

515
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:10,010
The more views you have, the easier it will be for you to do that analysis and adjustment.

516
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:14,730
Some important metrics to look at on the repricing results screen, price changes,

517
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,730
cost changes.

518
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,250
Does the item have a UPP that's limiting my floor?

519
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,730
What is my floor and ceiling?

520
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,370
Could those be expanded?

521
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,610
What's the comparison price?

522
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:30,930
Is it way below my floor and then there's no reason I can't compete at all?

523
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:35,170
Is it within the realm of possibility that I compete with that price?

524
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,170
Who's the competitor?

525
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:43,170
It shows you the last re-price event, the shipping price used at the time of calculation.

526
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,210
Is that accurate?

527
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,450
Can that be adjusted?

528
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:51,090
Is there a reason it's not accurate, such as inaccurate DIMM data?

529
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,490
A really important one is price policy changes.

530
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:58,650
You will see the item moving between price policies and that really tells you the narrative

531
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,650
of how effectively your triggers and controllers are working.

532
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:08,730
An example would be I can work with your CSM to look at the repricing results screen

533
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,930
in your system because the data is client specific.

534
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:17,490
I haven't shown anything in terms of the details, but you can see a, oh, I won the

535
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,490
buy box.

536
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,490
And then I lost the buy box, so I started seeking down and I seek down to a certain price

537
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,810
and that got me the buy box.

538
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,490
And then I was in the buy box for an hour and I started seeking up.

539
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,170
You can see that narrative play out in the repricing results screen.

540
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:37,740
And so it's important to leverage this screen when you're doing that analysis.

541
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,740
As I mentioned-

542
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:44,180
James, a quick one that I think kind of fits in right there.

543
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:53,820
Why the commission is out of the formula and you put it at the end, I'm not sure.

544
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,820
He's talking about-

545
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:01,110
Well, we're going way back.

546
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,510
Right.

547
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,750
So he's talking about having a like plus commission here.

548
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,510
That's really a business decision.

549
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:16,070
But what that means is I'm not putting, I'm not, my total cost doesn't include commission.

550
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:21,390
So I find out my total cost, I figure out my margin based on those total costs, and then

551
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,750
I add my commission on top of that.

552
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,430
Because the commission could vary by where you're selling also.

553
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,430
Yes.

554
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:33,070
Alternatively, you could have permission be included in your total cost basis.

555
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:37,230
It's really a business decision on whether you handle commission as part of your total

556
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:42,950
cost basis or you add it at the end.

557
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:47,310
Some people offer free shipping, so they exclude the shipping cost token because they don't

558
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:51,030
need that in their price.

559
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,710
Or they take their item cost, adjust that by a margin, take their shipping cost, adjust

560
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,590
that by a margin.

561
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:06,030
And then, so it's just a nuance in the way you're calculating your margin and adding

562
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,600
on those additional variables.

563
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,560
So some examples of price policy and structures that I've set up that have been successful.

564
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,520
FBA Stockage Loop, very simply use the stockage trigger, move an item to a different policy

565
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,280
with the lower floor as the stockage increases.

566
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,880
Sales Velocity Seek Loop, you utilize the sales velocity trigger.

567
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,840
You set an upper and lower threshold for what you consider high and low sales.

568
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,640
If you have low sales, you move your seek down policy.

569
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,960
And if you have high sales, you move your seek up, either trying to lower your margin

570
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,000
to the point where people are buying or increasing your margin to maximize how much money you

571
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,640
make as people are buying.

572
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,840
And then, within the seek down, you can have additional triggers to reevaluate.

573
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,560
But you're essentially, you're finding a, you're either not selling the item, you

574
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,720
seek down, so you find a price point that it sells at, and you start selling it.

575
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,120
Or you're selling a lot of it, and you want to see how much you can increase the price

576
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,800
before the sales decrease.

577
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,800
And then the whole buy box loop is a classic Amazon behavior, but essentially you either

578
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,600
use relative amount or a seek function.

579
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:23,560
And if you win the buy box, you hold the price, and then sometimes you have a timer

580
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,200
trigger which says after an hour, if I'm still in the buy box, increase the price till

581
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,480
I lose it.

582
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,560
But essentially, if I lose the buy box, I then respond by lowering my price until I win

583
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,880
it again.

584
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,600
So if you're interested in any of these three different loops being part of your environment,

585
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:50,240
talk to your CSM, James, it looks like we've exposed a tremendous amount of power, a tremendous

586
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:59,360
amount of capability and flexibility, but in, I'm going to use an old Marvel movie reference

587
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:04,800
from Spider-Man with great response, with great power comes great responsibility.

588
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,520
If you have any questions on how this works or what you're trying to accomplish, or what

589
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,320
is that business goal, please talk to your CSM.

590
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,520
As much power as you're bringing to bear, you can all, we don't want to make mistakes.

591
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,280
So that's where we are.

592
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:31,440
I'm looking for other, more questions as we get into our Q&A session.

593
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,520
Well this one, thank you, this is pretty cool, how do I learn more?

594
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:45,520
I think we've said it about a half dozen times, just talk to Jason or Jeff or James or myself

595
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:52,760
or whoever your CSM here is here at ETail Solutions.

596
00:44:52,760 --> 00:45:00,080
We love focusing on these kind of topics to improve the business and really getting you

597
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,440
to where you're going.

598
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,060
We want to make you smart enough to go it alone, but we want to give you enough reasons

599
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:12,600
to work with us that you don't have to and know that there's somebody with you all the

600
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,260
way.

601
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,760
Are there any other questions?

602
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,160
I think we do.

603
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:27,520
I got to keep clicking around to get them in here.

604
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:36,920
If we cannot match or beat the buy box price item at floor, can we yo-yo on a schedule to

605
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,040
trick the algorithms?

606
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,680
Yeah, so what that question is getting at is, as many people know on those competitive

607
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,640
marketplaces it's a race condition of the floor and then everyone sits at their lowest price

608
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:56,200
and what many people figured out is everyone's using an automated repricer, so I jump my price

609
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:02,200
up really high, everyone follows me and kind of prices a penny below my really high price.

610
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,280
It starts working your way down again, but everybody's making a little bit more for a

611
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,280
while.

612
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:14,640
Well, you pull everyone up off the floor because you can win the buy box with the

613
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,640
higher price if your latency is good, but essentially you do want to evaluate our items

614
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,200
just sitting at the floor and there is a trigger that says at floor price, you can then have

615
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:34,160
a behavior occur and say, hey, instead of sitting at my floor, seek up by an excessive

616
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,960
amount for an hour and see if that changes the behavior of the buy box and then put

617
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,400
it back in a seek down after I went way up.

618
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:49,640
Or you can go, oh, I'm at the floor, oftentimes with relative amount, if you can't beat anyone

619
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,600
with the relative amount adjustments, you default to your floor.

620
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,880
So if you find that occurring, have a trigger in your relative amount rule that says if

621
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,520
at floor, move it to a seek rule that elevates your price up above your floor and start

622
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,400
seeking the price.

623
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:14,100
And again, it's all about applying different strategies that all work in tandem with each

624
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,740
other via the loops that's driven by the triggers.

625
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:24,900
So yes, you can achieve a sort of yo-yoing effect that drives the price up and down.

626
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,020
Here's another one, James.

627
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:33,100
Do all these features work for my Shopify and Walmart marketplaces?

628
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:38,780
Controllers, triggers, and lookup tables work on all sales channels.

629
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:43,060
What triggers are available will be dependent on the marketplace.

630
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,340
For example, eBay doesn't have a buy box, so there's no buy box trigger.

631
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,340
Got it.

632
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:55,660
And then Amazon and Walmart will have slightly nuanced repricing configuration options because

633
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,060
of the data they provide.

634
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:04,500
But the core structure behind triggers, controllers, and lookup tables and price formula work with

635
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
all channels.

636
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,820
And I'm sorry to say this is going to have to be our last one because we're actually

637
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,660
over a little bit.

638
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:32,730
What is the advanced tab inside of the pricing policy screen used for?

639
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:37,370
You may remember I mentioned custom scripts about catalog in the catalog source webinar.

640
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:38,850
That's a similar idea.

641
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:47,250
You can work with your CSM to have the product team build a custom script that initiates

642
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,490
a certain type of behavior.

643
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,890
It'd be a very nuanced scenario that would.

644
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:52,890
Very specialized.

645
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:57,370
You'd reach the conclusion that you couldn't achieve that behavior with the functions available

646
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,530
and we would write a custom script.

647
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,530
Okay.

648
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:01,810
But yeah.

649
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:08,130
And again, my goal here was to give you the knowledge to A, kind of take a stab at yourself

650
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:12,330
and B, engage in a meaningful conversation with your CSM where you can present ideas

651
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:17,810
that can be implemented versus me having to go, well, that's not quite how the system

652
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,730
works, so I can't achieve that.

653
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:21,730
That's reasonable.

654
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:22,730
All right.

655
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:29,290
And I encourage you to look at the supplementary material, see if you can answer those questions,

656
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:34,330
and then reach out to your CSM and have them set up a session to review a bit more in depth

657
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:39,730
in your system because there can be a lot more learned about the re-pricing results screen

658
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,130
and what you have in place when you dive into your specifics.

659
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:49,280
Can we get to the next screen then as we wrap this up, James?

660
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:57,240
So once again, second Wednesday of the month, that means that next month it's going to

661
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,560
be on May 10th.

662
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:07,940
Right now, we believe we're going to focus on Dam or excuse me, Dam dynamic auto-matching.

663
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:15,960
How do you add a large number of SKUs safely into your Amazon marketplace?

664
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,680
And we'll go into that.

665
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:23,800
But once again, on your survey, if there's a topic that is of greater importance to the

666
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,480
majority of you, that's what we'll do.

667
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,720
That's how we got to pricing this month, was because of your feedback.

668
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,880
Also, remember your quarterly surveys.

669
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,080
Please fill those out.

670
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:46,320
And you will have access to this webinar, to the PowerPoint, and to the pricing documentation

671
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,040
available.

672
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:55,160
And every webinar will come with those three digital assets so that you can review, go

673
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:03,640
into areas that you were less comfortable with, and review as you try, and with our assistance,

674
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:10,720
drive your company successfully to a higher, faster-growing organization with more profit.

675
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,480
And with that, thank you.
