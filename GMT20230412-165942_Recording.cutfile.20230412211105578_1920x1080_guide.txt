## Quick Steps

1. Great.
2. Yeah.
3. Yeah.
4. Yeah.
5. Right.
6. So today, we're not going to go to the next slide yet, but James and I are going to be.
7. Why is this important?
8. This is as important as any module we have.
9. What type of marketplace are you on?
10. The next most important thing to think about and understand is, what is your business's.
11. But really understanding what allows you to be set apart from the rest.
12. There is some documentation on the Help Center about shipping cost models that you can reference,.
13. But putting some time and effort into understanding your shipping cost model setup would be a.
14. Sets.
15. Catalog in terms of large groups, individual SKUs, and sort of small subsets of.
16. Very important.
17. You have a lot of reports available to identify that information, but it's important to have.
18. It's important to win the buy box, but you want to apply strategies in such a way that.
19. On this product and increasing volume of a certain subset of products.
20. Technology and what you will find is you'll apply a strategy.
21. Repricer will capture what you're doing and apply a counter strategy.
22. And so it's never good to set up strategies in Q1 and forget about them.
23. But again, it's important to understand what the competition is doing to your price and.
24. Whether it's important to respond to their price events or maybe you want to ignore them.
25. But again, these are the high level mindsets and considerations you should have as you.
26. The very first thing you're going to start with is selection criteria.
27. So selection criteria is used in various parts of the system in EVP, but what it is is it's.
28. And the reason it's important to have a grasp on how selection criteria can work and how.
29. Selection criteria?
30. So you need to be able to identify groups of SKUs with selection criteria.
31. So your ability to nuance selection criteria defines your ability to nuance your pricing.
32. It's important to familiarize yourselves with the options available.
33. I encourage you to present a scenario and then work with your CSM to get the selection.
34. But knowing the selection criteria limitations will help you from kind of putting out, oh,.
35. It's not possible because selection criteria doesn't have that function.
36. So knowing the functions of selection criteria is important.
37. And then what selection criteria will do will automatically assign items to enabled policies.
38. Second there, we will use this selection criteria to assign an item to the policy.
39. You can manipulate and adjust this using the bulk updater on the sales channel screen.
40. A pricing policy with matching selection criteria must be enabled.
41. Again, the selection criteria is used to automatically assign an item.
42. Most people will find they'll click reprice.
43. That means you don't have a selection criteria option that would meet that specific SKU.
44. So that's an important thing to have in place.
45. This is also important to know if there's no inventory to publish, then the system cannot.
46. So it's important to make sure you have some exposed inventory if you are looking for repricing.
47. And you really do need to go back and check those and get good data in those selections.
48. Your floor and ceiling set the upper and lower price ranges and your target sets your.
49. So that's why getting your shipping cost as accurate as possible is very important.
50. But each policy will have its own set of pricing formula, and they will all.
51. And I can reprice by an amount or a percent based on the type of seller.
52. An important thing to understand here is if these numbers are positive,.
53. Partner with the digital assets that we are providing.
54. Adjusting by an amount up or down over a fixed period of time.
55. If a policy has the hold controller set up, we hold that price.
56. After seeking down for 12 hours, I want to apply a different strategy.
57. And so you apply strategies that are enforceable versus coming up with ideas.
58. Two important notes about triggers.
59. So if you remember on the slide before, I said selection criteria is used.
60. After it's been assigned via selection criteria.
61. So I have a default policy that captures the SKU selection criteria,.
62. But it is important to note, I have many people ask,.
63. Historically, we found people setting up 20 different policies,.
64. And so you can see in this formula, instead of having to fix number,.
65. So here I go to the floor margin.
66. Dimension is selection criteria.
67. Again, I emphasize this is why it's really important to know how selection criteria works.
68. And what's capable and what's not capable of selection criteria.
69. Again, this is all selection criteria based.
70. And when you have this set up and all the facets are working together, you have a really.
71. Each piece, it makes a lot of sense and it will click and you will go, oh, I need to.
72. To go to the stock dimension and adjust those numbers.
73. Oh, I'm going to my price policy and adjusting my controller and setting the rate to be faster.
74. A pro tip to make that more efficient for you is to select a channel.
75. Set up filters and columns that make sense for analyzing a broad group of items or a.
76. Specific group of items on sale or items within a certain policy and then save those.
77. Not have to recreate your views.
78. Some important metrics to look at on the repricing results screen, price changes,.
79. A really important one is price policy changes.
80. And so it's important to leverage this screen when you're doing that analysis.
81. So some examples of price policy and structures that I've set up that have been successful.
82. You set an upper and lower threshold for what you consider high and low sales.
83. I got to keep clicking around to get them in here.
84. And again, it's all about applying different strategies that all work in tandem with each.
85. A certain type of behavior.
