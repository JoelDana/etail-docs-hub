## Quick Steps

1. Yep.
2. Exactly.
3. Yeah.
4. Uh,
5. Um,
6. You're going to miss a great session today, but as always, you'll be able to find it on the Help Center.
7. Once again, you can get it through the Help Center. It gives you a link to the Knowledge Center,.
8. And maybe get more context or level set for some of the topics we're going to talk about today.
9. And what you need, the mindset you should be putting yourself in.
10. You create a window where you can be very successful.
11. Is set up a sales velocity-based seek loop,.
12. Is the sales velocity of all these skews important.
13. Or are all these listings important.
14. Or is it more important to assess it on an individual basis?
15. And then setting up initial sales velocity policies.
16. It creates a notification event that we then download and assess,.
17. So I can decide based on who the seller is, what type of it is,.
18. You can find, exit, and enter prices for the buy box.
19. When did I enter a hold buy box rule?
20. So what this does is it says, if I apply this trigger,.
21. The delay setting you see here and on a few other triggers,.
22. What it does if I set this to five minutes,.
23. I instigate a certain type of behavior.
24. When you're setting up your seek loops,.
25. What I've done with some clients that's been successful as I've set up.
26. Tier set of policies that I talked about is a stock age gets older.
27. Uh, some clients, uh, often deal with UPP or map price.
28. It essentially means you can't sell below this point set by the.
29. If you go to system, the system module set up in the top banner,.
30. We set up a basic logic statement on how it's handled.
31. If you're having UPP map management problems,.
32. Apply.
33. I think it is so important to have a standardized pricing policy or an,.
34. Uh, have a map policy in place.
35. And it'll help create enforce with your approved sellers.
36. And it's really important as a brand to take control,.
37. Notice and going and scrambling to fix it.
38. Leveraged in selection criteria.
39. I have six marketplaces to sign up, set up and reprice and get working.
40. Process, pick on a channel, focus on setting up the.
41. Set the others to price parity, um,.
42. The mode you'll click that dropdown.
43. Set them up as lookup tables.
44. You go to a location,.
45. You can set up per order per item.
46. You can set up the lookup tables to achieve the ultimate goal.
47. With re-pricing, go use the bulk update tool.
48. And then leverage that attribute in the selection criteria.
49. What selection criteria do I use.
50. Versus a grouping that I manually create?
51. If that's what your setup looks like,.
52. You can see when you exited and entered the buy box,.
53. And the behavior of your setup.
54. I think also remember that while pricing is important.
55. Latency is also very important.
56. To help you set up lookup tables.
57. Without setup that isolates and handles that very specifically.
58. You can have your selection criteria.
59. It's more about what type of product it is.
60. And then in home goods, it's really the type of product.
61. Does UPP override MAP for re-pricing?
62. MAP is actually more of just a stored data point in EVP.
63. If you want MAP to be leveraged.
64. So again, MAP is just stored in EVP.
65. So if you're hyper aware or wanna be vigilant on UPP slash MAP,.
66. MAP has no influence on pricing.
67. We'd like to set our re-pricing to compete against.
68. After the session is over in the Help Center,.
69. In the Knowledge Center.
