1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,770
Well, thank you for joining.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,770
Here we are at the May edition of Tech Edge,

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,730
the ETail Solutions webinar series

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,650
for our clients on how to better utilize

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,650
and get more value out of their EVP instance.

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,770
With you again this month are myself, Jeff Burkard.

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,710
I'm a partner success manager here,

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,490
and you may be tired of looking at his face,

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,390
but for the third month in a row,

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,810
James Davis is our subject matter expert.

11
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,810
James is well-versed in all aspects of the software,

12
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,090
and it is a little bit of a coincidence

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,210
that he has been the subject matter expert for the first three.

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,410
I guarantee you that you will be seeing some new,

15
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,070
fresher, and better looking faces over the coming months.

16
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,070
This month is a subject that you picked

17
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,350
by filling out the survey at the end of last month's session,

18
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,350
10 features that you need to grow your business,

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,190
and 10 features that will help automate your business

20
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,550
and make it easier to run.

21
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,190
And the whole idea is,

22
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,190
how can we make you more efficient doing the basic things

23
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,590
so that you can focus on higher value things

24
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,430
that actually can move the needle for your business?

25
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,430
So without too much more introduction,

26
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,630
James, it's your show.

27
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,350
Yeah, so here are the topics we're gonna run through.

28
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,670
Again, I'm gonna spend about a minute to two minutes

29
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,830
on each topic.

30
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,710
As always, if there's one topic that interests you,

31
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,350
contact your CSM about it,

32
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,710
and you can engage in a more in-depth discussion

33
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,570
about how it can apply to your environment specifically.

34
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,710
Also, please, oh, go ahead.

35
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,490
Put those questions in so that we can address them.

36
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,270
Some of them will be right if they're very specific

37
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,070
to one of these 10 topics while we're in it,

38
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,950
we'll address it.

39
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,630
Otherwise, we'll roll back at the end

40
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,470
during our Q&A session.

41
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,990
As always, please fill out the survey

42
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,870
that we send after the webinar

43
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,150
so we can get your feedback to improve these

44
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,550
and make sure that the topics are relevant

45
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,390
for what you guys are looking for.

46
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,510
And finally, the webinars are recorded

47
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,830
and available on the Help Center,

48
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,950
which you can access via a link

49
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,080
at the top of where you're creating tickets.

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,840
After I cover these 10 topics,

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,440
Jeff has got a surprise bonus topic

52
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,640
that will be, it's very interesting.

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,440
I'm excited about the stuff he's covering

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,140
and rolling that out to some of you guys

55
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,680
over the next two quarters.

56
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,820
We'll have Q&A,

57
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,680
and then we'll talk about the next Tech Edge.

58
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,480
As always, ETails' mission is to drive growth and profits

59
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,000
for you guys through the platform.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,760
So again, these tools we are going to cover today

61
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,280
have been developed over a number of years

62
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,840
as we have solved problems for our clients,

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,340
turning them into tools to be leveraged by others.

64
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,800
And so the first tool I'm going to cover

65
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
is the Amazon Competitive Analysis tool.

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,920
This has its own screen with an EVP

67
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,000
and is an Amazon Market Assessment tool.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What it allows you to do is take a list of potential SKUs

69
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,680
with identifying information such as UPC or part number,

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,040
search those SKUs on Amazon,

71
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,320
and get results and information about potential ASINs.

72
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,720
So I can see and make a determination on,

73
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,400
is it worth investing to sell this product?

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,600
Can I compete?

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,000
What will my estimated profit margins be?

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,640
What are the buy box prices looking like?

77
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,680
These are all data points you would get

78
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,320
from the Competitive Analysis tool.

79
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,040
You can also see, hey, no one's selling this ASIN

80
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,400
or selling this SKU under this UPC,

81
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
so there's potential there to create it.

82
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,120
The main function of this tool is to assess,

83
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,880
can I be competitive on Amazon?

84
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,440
What does the market look like for this particular product set?

85
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,480
The most common use of this tool

86
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,080
is I have a supplier reach out

87
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,520
or I'm looking at a potential supplier.

88
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,480
I can get their catalog information,

89
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,680
run it through this tool and make an evaluation

90
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,160
on whether or not I can compete.

91
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,640
You may make a business decision,

92
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,160
hey, we're going to integrate this supplier,

93
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,360
but we're not going to worry about Amazon,

94
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,880
or you can make the decision, hey, I can't.

95
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,840
Amazon's my driver of most of my revenue.

96
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,800
This SKU, this catalog of SKUs

97
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,440
is going to be very difficult to compete,

98
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,760
so it doesn't make sense to move forward.

99
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,760
Again, this tool helps you analyze

100
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,360
the market conditions on Amazon for specific products

101
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,640
to make a determination on, could I compete?

102
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,340
Should I get involved in that market for that SKU?

103
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,740
The next tool I'm talking about is dynamic restrictions.

104
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,700
Dynamic restrictions are located on the catalog module.

105
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,340
They have their own screen here.

106
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,380
It's a listing management tool

107
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,220
that allows you to prevent the creation of SKUs

108
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,820
that meet certain conditions.

109
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,180
Again, I've brought up selection criteria

110
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,420
during each webinar.

111
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,020
It's used again here.

112
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,580
If an item meets a certain set of conditions,

113
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,420
then it will be restricted on the configured channels.

114
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,460
Again, I can have multiple restrictions

115
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,780
of various conditions and channels,

116
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,700
but what it does is it prevents that,

117
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,580
prevents those SKUs from getting published,

118
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,900
so you can not have to worry

119
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,180
about getting marketplace violations,

120
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,660
brand pull-down notices, things of that nature.

121
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,180
If you create a restriction

122
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,420
and the system finds active listings

123
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,700
that match that restriction,

124
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,540
it will attempt to disable it and pull it down.

125
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,380
We're optimizing that feature set,

126
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,500
so right now I would make sure to manually check

127
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,580
so that everything's pulled down successfully,

128
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,540
but that is the action that is attempted to take.

129
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,460
It is dependent on the marketplace,

130
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,460
how far down we can delist it,

131
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,980
but at a minimum it should start publishing zero,

132
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,820
which will prevent you

133
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,780
from selling on restricted marketplaces.

134
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,260
Again, you can enable this per channel.

135
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,660
You can create restrictions that affect multiple channels,

136
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,700
but you can get very granular in controlling

137
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,220
where I do and do not create listings.

138
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,780
This will affect listing creation processes

139
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,580
like the dynamic automature and the item creators

140
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,460
will work in tandem with this tool and know,

141
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,620
okay, I'm creating listings,

142
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,620
but this item's restricted, so I'm not gonna create it.

143
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,540
Most common usages of this feature

144
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,780
are manufacturer restrictions,

145
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,220
you're onboarding a new supplier,

146
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,300
but you know certain brands can only be sold

147
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
on your own website,

148
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,740
so you need to restrict them from third-party marketplaces.

149
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,700
You may also sell hazardous material or liquids

150
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,700
and certain marketplaces don't want to

151
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,700
or the business expense of those orders is too great,

152
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,500
so I wanna restrict them,

153
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,260
but again, if you can think of business scenarios

154
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,980
where you need to make sure

155
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,340
you're not selling certain products in certain places,

156
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,500
the dynamic restriction tool

157
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,420
should certainly be leveraged there.

158
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,540
James, if I'm bringing in a new catalog

159
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,580
and there's a whole manufacturer that I can't sell,

160
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,300
when using the catalog source,

161
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,140
should I restrict it at the time of importing

162
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,260
or filter it out or do it with dynamic restrictions?

163
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,340
What Jeff's asking is if I got a new catalog

164
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,260
and I know part of it's restricted,

165
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,180
when I create the supplier record,

166
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,860
should I just filter those out and not create them at all?

167
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,980
It's really a business decision

168
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,220
on whether you think you're gonna be able

169
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,220
to sell those things in the future.

170
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,980
You can certainly add checks

171
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,900
in the catalog source creation tool

172
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,580
to prevent those listings from being created.

173
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,260
I would add a dynamic restriction

174
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,140
as you know, a double safety in that condition,

175
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,740
but you can restrict it at the catalog source level,

176
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,340
but if you think there's potential to sell it in the future,

177
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,580
I would encourage creating the supplier records

178
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,820
and leveraging the dynamic restriction tool.

179
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,260
Got it.

180
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,580
The third feature that you should be aware about

181
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,540
and be aware about is the eBay D-List ReList tool.

182
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,300
This is a listing publication optimization tool

183
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,300
that promotes the freshness of eBay listings.

184
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,140
60% of eBay's revenue comes from listings

185
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,820
that they see as fresh.

186
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,900
Their indexer optimizes those for visibility.

187
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,340
We've had information provided us through various sources

188
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,420
that after seven days, a listing starts to get suppressed

189
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,380
and after 14 days, it's completely buried.

190
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,300
What impacts freshness is sort of like

191
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,220
the buy box algorithm, there's ideas,

192
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,180
but obviously it's proprietary,

193
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,020
but things like cost changes, adding new images,

194
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,900
title changes all seem to promote the freshness

195
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,380
of a listing which improve its visibility.

196
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,060
Another key aspect is it's on eBay,

197
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,660
you have an eBay item ID.

198
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,900
How old is that item ID?

199
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,620
After a certain age, again, eBay has indicated

200
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,660
that they suppress it.

201
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,020
So getting a new fresh eBay item ID

202
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,140
can help promote listing visibility on eBay.

203
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,540
What the eBay D-List ReList tool does for you

204
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,780
is you set various parameters

205
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,660
about how many I wanna re-list and de-list

206
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,220
and the system does it for you.

207
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,460
We'll take a listing down, republish it,

208
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,500
that will give it a new item ID

209
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,980
and then the idea is that increases its freshness

210
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,020
promoting its visibility.

211
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,460
We've implemented this tool in a number of clients

212
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,220
and we've seen an increase in eBay revenue.

213
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,300
So again, I encourage you to reach out to your CSM

214
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,780
so we can configure this and implement it.

215
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,780
We have various reports to show the impact it's made.

216
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,180
We are working on a refinement

217
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,740
to allow the system to be smart enough

218
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,620
to know when reinsertion fees start to be incurred

219
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,780
and throttle the re-listing.

220
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,580
So right now, if you do enable it,

221
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,780
you'll wanna be aware of your eBay account listing limits

222
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,660
so that you don't incur insertion fees

223
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,100
after you've reached your allotted amount.

224
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,940
But again, this tool is very powerful

225
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,300
in helping drive sales on eBay

226
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,940
and keep your listings fresh so that they're visible.

227
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,580
We kinda know that eBay

228
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,020
is probably not your number one marketplace anymore

229
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,020
unless you're in a very specific catalog automotive typically

230
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,900
but we're always looking for ways

231
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,220
that can increase the growth,

232
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,940
find ways that other people aren't finding to help you grow.

233
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,940
And we're gonna try and package these different services,

234
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,940
couple different eBay things that can juice your sales

235
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,340
into a package to make it easy to go for you to say,

236
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,860
I know it's not big,

237
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,460
but I wanna see if I can boost it by 10, 15, 20%

238
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,060
my eBay business.

239
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,220
So talk to your CSMs.

240
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,340
Yeah, well, to build off of that,

241
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,460
we've got a number of eBay enhancement tools

242
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,660
that we've kind of packaged together

243
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,180
related to re-pricing, this re-list,

244
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,260
delisting, air management.

245
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,860
And so again, reach out to your CSM

246
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,860
to see how we can deploy that trifecta of features

247
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,960
to your eBay environment to try and promote sales.

248
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,800
The fourth topic I'm covering today

249
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,280
is order action rules and tags.

250
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,000
Order action rules and tags are an order management tool.

251
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,880
It allows the sales order screen

252
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,320
to work for you, not against you.

253
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,840
What the order action rules do

254
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,600
is it creates automated behavior based on order conditions.

255
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,120
So you can see here,

256
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,280
it's its own type of selection criteria

257
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,520
but it functions in the very same way.

258
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,260
If an order meets the conditions, we can take an action.

259
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,900
One of the actions you can take is you can add a tag.

260
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,500
There's an unlimited number of tags you can have.

261
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,140
Obviously you don't want too many

262
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,100
but as they lose their function,

263
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,300
but you can add a tag.

264
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,540
When an order meets a condition

265
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,780
and on the sales order screen,

266
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,700
I can filter on all orders that have that tag.

267
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,500
One tag I've seen clients use

268
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,300
is any order over a hundred pounds.

269
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,540
I want a tag added to it

270
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,540
so I can filter on those orders.

271
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,220
Any order with expedited shipping,

272
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,380
I want a tag added to it

273
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,060
so I can filter on those orders.

274
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,700
There are other actions you can take.

275
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,020
You can assign a service level.

276
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,460
Any order that comes in for this SKU on Shopify,

277
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,140
I want to make sure it ships next day air

278
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,180
because I'm having a promotion or something of that nature.

279
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,020
You can also put orders on hold for a period of time

280
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,820
or until they're manually released.

281
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,740
This is a big one for the automotive space.

282
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,140
If I'm selling spark plugs,

283
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,940
I want to make sure the pack quantity is right

284
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,380
or if I'm selling a bumper,

285
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,420
I want to make sure that my shipping cost is covered.

286
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,300
So again, think about the business conditions

287
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,220
that you would like to try and capture

288
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,860
as we pull in orders

289
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,740
and work with your CSM to set up order action rules

290
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,200
to optimize your fulfillment workflow.

291
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,620
There's a variety of conditions we can identify

292
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,420
and a number of actions we can take.

293
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,800
Again, the tags allow for order grouping

294
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,690
and optimized filtering on the sales results screen.

295
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,890
And I discussed some of these common usages,

296
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,930
but the best method is to think about the business scenario,

297
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,530
engage with your CSM,

298
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,270
and they can work towards setting up

299
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:43,620
multiple order action rules that work for you.

300
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,780
On one of our previous webinars,

301
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,620
we covered the re-pricing at a 101 level,

302
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,220
and I had discussed the re-pricing results screen.

303
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,460
Specifically on the re-pricing results screen,

304
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,060
the buy box percent delta can be very powerful

305
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,860
for re-pricing assessment.

306
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,780
What it allows you to do is look at your price

307
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,380
and how far away you are from the buy box.

308
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,540
So if I'm within 5% of the buy box,

309
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,740
there may be potential for me to compete.

310
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,980
I want to assign those items to a rule with a lower floor

311
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,220
or one that seeks down more aggressively

312
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,020
because there's potential, I'm pretty close.

313
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,980
If I can get my price down a little bit,

314
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
I can compete with the buy box.

315
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,500
On the flip side, I can look at items

316
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,340
that are so far from the buy box,

317
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,020
they're not even close, 20% away, 15% away.

318
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,340
And I can think about those SKUs strategically.

319
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,900
Do I kit and bundle them and create a new ASIN?

320
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,500
Do I white label them or do I just kind of, you know,

321
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,060
cut my losses and leave them as they are?

322
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,820
But again, it gives you visibility on groups of SKUs

323
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,460
and how close you are to competing for the buy box price.

324
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,220
And then make strategic decisions

325
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,980
about what pricing strategies you want to apply

326
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,580
to those items.

327
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,020
Again, a very powerful,

328
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,540
the re-pricing results screen has a lot of potential,

329
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,780
but this is definitely a filter you should utilize

330
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,140
when you're looking at your Amazon re-pricing results.

331
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,900
I think when a lot of you look at

332
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,560
your very, very large catalogs,

333
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,820
even the ones that you don't sell often,

334
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,740
and more importantly,

335
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,220
the ones that you literally have

336
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,980
as a consultant six months to a year,

337
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,740
why are we dealing with those on a daily basis?

338
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,740
They take time away from your top 10 or 20% of your products.

339
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,100
Focus on what makes you money.

340
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:47,140
One usage of this filter client identified the listings

341
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,660
that were really, really out of,

342
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,240
he had an inability to compete,

343
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,860
but he knew they were hot sellers,

344
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,620
so he worked with his supplier to buy them in bulk

345
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,740
at a reduced cost so he could get into that.

346
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,180
Oh, that's great.

347
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,580
He didn't drop ship the item

348
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,180
because the supplier wasn't gonna do it at that cost,

349
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,020
but he was able to go,

350
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,700
hey, this item sells,

351
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,980
but I need it at this cost so I can compete.

352
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,180
He worked out a deal with his supplier

353
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,980
and he was able to start competing on that buy box.

354
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,580
But again, this is an assessment tool

355
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,020
that gives you visibility on,

356
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,060
hey, these SKUs,

357
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,220
I need to apply this strategy

358
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,580
on these really uncompetitive SKUs.

359
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,620
I need to either acknowledge that I'm ignoring them

360
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,540
or apply a creative strategy.

361
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,280
Again, I encourage hits and bundling

362
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,380
because you can create your own ASIN off of that

363
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,240
and then you're the only seller.

364
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,380
So find products that pair together well

365
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,640
that aren't competitive on their own.

366
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,760
Number six, many of you may be familiar with this tool,

367
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,120
but it is very important to be aware of what it can do

368
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,800
and the actions it can take.

369
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,120
The bulk updater is a listing management tool

370
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,560
that allows bulk changes and forced actions.

371
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,260
They're listed on the screen.

372
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,120
There's some trees down each option.

373
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,600
So I'd be familiar with them,

374
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,720
but you can do things like force a price calculation,

375
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,500
force publishing, change listing status, check restrictions.

376
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,680
I've just added a new dynamic restriction.

377
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,400
I select all my Amazon listings, check restriction.

378
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,800
It'll start that process of,

379
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,380
hey, these listings need to be restricted and publish zero.

380
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,220
I'm shipping policy assignment.

381
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,860
I've just added a new shipping template to eBay.

382
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,660
I need to make sure these items that want to use it

383
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,960
are assigned to it, I can do that assessment.

384
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,960
One activity I always encourage is isolate items and error

385
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,920
on a specific channel,

386
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,200
bulk update through existing bulk update force publication

387
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,000
and then check in 48 hour, 24 hours later

388
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,380
and see if any of the error message return.

389
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,380
A lot of times those error messages just go away

390
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,400
and then you can isolate the reoccurring error messages.

391
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,540
Another action, I have a group of listings.

392
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,180
I want to make sure our pricing,

393
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,260
I can isolate them, do a force price calculation

394
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,720
and a force price publishing.

395
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,660
This can be good for new listings that you've just created.

396
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,940
If you don't wanna wait for the background tasks to run,

397
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,260
you can kind of do it yourself here.

398
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,260
So again, the bulk update tool has a lot of potential

399
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,100
and I encourage you to think about using it before.

400
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,140
What I see a lot of times is people

401
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,980
export the sales listing screen,

402
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,560
import it with the catalog source

403
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,580
to do some sort of manipulation that they could have achieved

404
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,900
with the bulk update, saving them some time.

405
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,860
You should also be aware you can update attribute values

406
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,780
with the bulk update tool for multiple listings.

407
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,220
So if I'm using the re-pricing class attribute,

408
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,260
for example, and I wanna change that,

409
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,620
I can select the listings on the screen

410
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,300
and do a bulk update.

411
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,940
Number seven is attribute and category mapping.

412
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,880
Attribute and category mapping allows you

413
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,580
to leverage your catalog data across multiple channels.

414
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,860
So often you will have a content rich channel,

415
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,460
whether that's a content channel

416
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,300
that's sort of a PIM integration or a content channel

417
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,500
like a eBay or Shopify where you've spent

418
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,620
probably hours building your own repertoire of content.

419
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,300
Or you've taken content for Amazon,

420
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,980
but you have a good source channel and you wanna go,

421
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,380
okay, on eBay, I need to provide my own content.

422
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,940
So I'm gonna take information from my content rich channel

423
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,140
and I'm gonna move it onto eBay.

424
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,780
On the screen, you can see an example.

425
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,060
I'm taking the material attribute from Amazon

426
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,540
from the supplier.

427
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,020
So my source is the supplier and that attribute is material

428
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,300
and I'm using it to populate the fabric attribute on Amazon.

429
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,260
So I don't have to go into the Amazon listing

430
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,980
and add an attribute so it has fabric.

431
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,380
It's leveraging my already present data.

432
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,540
This can also apply to categories.

433
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,940
A major area to leverage this is for Walmart,

434
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,940
which doesn't have a native category assignment tool.

435
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,380
So I always encourage my clients to go,

436
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,060
my eBay categories are good or my Shopify categories are good.

437
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,060
Go up to this category mapping tool and it allows you to say,

438
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,060
hey, if this SKU is on Shopify in this category,

439
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
put it in this category on Walmart.

440
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,300
And this can help optimize category assignment,

441
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,860
which ultimately results in better search results

442
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,260
as people will go down the search trees of certain categories

443
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,300
and find your product.

444
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,020
Another place to leverage this is the eBay required attribute,

445
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,660
required attributes, certain categories require certain attributes.

446
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,780
You can find a pattern of common ones, color, size, type,

447
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,780
find a source for that data, map it to eBay,

448
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,260
and that addresses that error and prevents it from occurring.

449
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,500
So again, it's a tool to maximize your content

450
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,860
across your various marketplaces.

451
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,660
Number eight, next best fulfillment is an order management tool

452
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,660
that allows you to find the second best solution.

453
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,420
It isn't enabled by default,

454
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,620
so you would need to work with your CSM.

455
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,900
It's just as simple as checking a checkbox,

456
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,020
but then you'll see this next best option

457
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,850
on the change fulfillment method screen.

458
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,450
Common usages of this feature

459
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,690
are routing around bad quantity data.

460
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,770
The suppliers let me know their inventory feeds inaccurate.

461
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,370
The system doesn't know that.

462
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,930
I need to take this group of orders and route them elsewhere.

463
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,850
Or I know that a distribution center

464
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,330
is having a temporary outage for a few hours

465
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,250
and these expedited orders need to ship.

466
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,490
So I select them, find the next best solution.

467
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,210
And another scenario is I'm selling from my stock.

468
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,450
I've got more orders than I can deal with.

469
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,930
I need to make sure that these things

470
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,010
get shipped out on time.

471
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,930
I know I can drop ship them,

472
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,090
select the orders I can't handle,

473
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,610
and I send them to a secondary source.

474
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,970
So again, it's a tool to leverage

475
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,650
when you're finding yourself

476
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,930
in need of a second best solution.

477
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,690
It's a use case tool,

478
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,410
but it is powerful in helping you route orders

479
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,410
and deal with the complexity of order fulfillment

480
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,690
when the best solution is not working out

481
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:33,840
or can't handle the orders.

482
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,000
Number nine is the item weight priority tool.

483
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,680
What this tool does is it helps you manage your DIMM data

484
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,760
from various sources.

485
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,680
It prioritizes and elevates them

486
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,880
to the master skew details page.

487
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,600
So when you open a skew

488
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,440
and you go to master skew details page

489
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,160
in the top corner, there's DIMM data.

490
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,600
That data is used for estimated shipping.

491
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,680
It's used for when we manifest shipping labels

492
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,280
and used in repricing.

493
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,200
So you wanna make sure it's accurate

494
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,240
and of the highest quality.

495
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,600
Now you may have initial DIMM data

496
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,000
provided by the supplier,

497
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,040
but as you ship stuff,

498
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,480
you get more accurate data into the system

499
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,800
and what the item weight priority tool lets you do

500
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,160
is assess multiple sources of DIMM data,

501
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,520
prioritize them,

502
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,960
and then slowly select from the best source available.

503
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,520
This is important to have in place

504
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,160
if you're using native shipping.

505
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,720
It's important to have in place

506
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,040
to get accurate estimated shipping costs.

507
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,160
A big problem I see is suppliers

508
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,320
tell you how big the item is.

509
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,880
So you have that DIMM data,

510
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,680
but that's not how big it is when it's in a box.

511
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,880
So your estimated shipping's off.

512
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,240
So as you aggregate better and better DIMM data,

513
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
you get better and better estimated shipping,

514
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,400
which means you can compete

515
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,320
and optimize your profitability.

516
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,720
The last area where this is...

517
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,640
Go ahead, John.

518
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,320
Oh, I was just gonna say that

519
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,360
beyond your actual product cost,

520
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,560
I think we're all starting to understand

521
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,920
unless you are not operationally excellent

522
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,800
in the way you manage your shipping

523
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,280
and your weights and your DIMM weights

524
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,680
and the way you work with your carriers

525
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,640
to get your estimates,

526
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,760
it is tough to make money.

527
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,600
This is just another tool to better manage your costs

528
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,560
to make sure that every shipment

529
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,440
that goes out the door is profitable.

530
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,740
Another powerful tool that's been slowly rolling out

531
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,380
into EVP is cartonization.

532
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,900
And accurate DIMM data is key for cartonization.

533
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,540
In a brief summary, cartonization allows you to say,

534
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,740
I have these set of boxes, they cost me this much

535
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,380
and they're this big in terms of volume.

536
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,660
The system then, when processing an order,

537
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,740
goes, hey, this order has four SKUs,

538
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,980
they'll all fit in this box, ship them in this box.

539
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Or you have four SKUs,

540
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,900
you're gonna have to use two boxes

541
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,980
because of the way the volume works out.

542
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,620
And then you can optimize your order flow

543
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,340
because the system's prompting the worker

544
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,700
or the order fulfillment person,

545
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,860
hey, I don't need to think about what box to use,

546
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,460
the system's telling me.

547
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,500
And then the cost of that box

548
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,860
has worked into your profitability.

549
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,060
So there's a lot of potential with cartonization

550
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,460
that starts with leveraging quality DIMM data

551
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,140
and the item weight priority tool

552
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,420
is the mechanism to get there.

553
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,900
And although cartonization will be probably

554
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,780
its own webinar topic in the future,

555
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,060
that situation where it created two boxes,

556
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,220
we can band those together

557
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,980
so that you only have one origination fee.

558
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,980
Number 10, monitors and alerts.

559
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,380
So as you're aware, we have background systems

560
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,420
monitoring the system performance at all times.

561
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,060
We send out alerts periodically

562
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,620
when we notice disruptions in behavior,

563
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,140
but you can also get visibility on your system performance

564
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,220
with these monitoring tools.

565
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,860
Specifically with issues,

566
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,940
you will see the issues screen below orders.

567
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,900
It's under leveraged in my experience

568
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,820
with a lot of clients

569
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,900
because there's so much information on it.

570
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,740
It gives you listing errors, it gives you task errors,

571
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,420
it can be hard to digest.

572
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,320
The solution to that is for you

573
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,440
to work with your CSM and isolate important errors

574
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,360
to know about.

575
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,360
A big one is inventory files failing to load from an FTP.

576
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,760
That causes a very specific error that we track.

577
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,920
We will create an issue,

578
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,480
but we can also send out email alerts to specific users.

579
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,800
If you have a fulfillment manager

580
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,440
and orders are failing to send or import,

581
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,440
that's an error message we can track for

582
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,920
and email users about so that they're aware

583
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,200
that there's something going on with tasks

584
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
that needs to be addressed

585
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,010
that's preventing optimized order flow.

586
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,970
Next, we have monitors.

587
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,450
Monitors track overall task performance.

588
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,810
So again, an issue is looking for a specific error message.

589
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,730
Monitors track the average volume load of that task

590
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,450
and will note spikes in it.

591
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,450
It will note task failures.

592
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,250
There's more to come on monitors.

593
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,770
We'll have a webinar session on it

594
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,710
with our monitor, Smee, Aaron Peck.

595
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,330
But again, talk to your CSM.

596
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,210
I encourage you to leverage issues

597
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,650
and see where that can benefit your team

598
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,730
and then move on to looking at monitors.

599
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,490
We are exposing that more and more.

600
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,810
We have some customers setting up their own monitors,

601
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,170
but again, work with your CSM,

602
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,490
focus on issue alerts first,

603
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,050
and then see where monitors might make sense for you as well.

604
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,130
Those are my 10 topics.

605
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,810
As noted in the agenda, Jeff, it's a surprise for us.

606
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:08,850
And now, drum roll, please,

607
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,570
something that a lot of you've been asking for

608
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,570
for a couple of years now,

609
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,050
we are happy to announce that ETail

610
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,930
is migrating to a browser.

611
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,930
We already have certain roles already migrated over,

612
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,770
and this is in production use in some of our new clients.

613
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,210
Today, the way we're migrating it,

614
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,770
we're taking roles and moving them over.

615
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,890
So there still may be things that you need to do

616
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:46,730
in your traditional EVP legacy platform.

617
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,730
There may be some things that you will always do in EVP.

618
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,450
System admin kind of level functions

619
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,850
are some very high-end power user kind of functions.

620
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,370
But for the people that just need to deal with the data

621
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,930
to do their normal daily task,

622
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,570
a CSM on order management person,

623
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:12,930
a somebody who handles the shipping and manifesting,

624
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:16,530
we're starting to roll out specific roles

625
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,050
to some of our newer clients.

626
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,330
And now we're gonna start talking to our current clients

627
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:26,890
about are there potential areas of their business

628
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,970
they would like to roll out.

629
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,770
Why don't we go to the next one?

630
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:36,850
And along with that, we are working on some functionality

631
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:41,370
where we're gonna be offering a standalone product

632
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:44,810
for new clients in the near future,

633
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,370
not formally announced yet.

634
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,290
So hopefully all of you are under NDA,

635
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,290
but we're calling it ideal order

636
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,250
that we're on every single order.

637
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,650
We're looking at, did it ship from the right location?

638
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,170
Was the right packaging used?

639
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,090
Was the right carrier used?

640
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,770
Was the right service level used?

641
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,010
Did all the documentation get included?

642
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,250
Did it ship on time?

643
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,730
Did it arrive on time?

644
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:14,210
We're tracking all those individual items per order

645
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,410
to tell you if an order was ideal

646
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,250
and did it meet your profit goals for that order?

647
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,850
And we're calling that ideal order.

648
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,090
Next one, we'll even look at,

649
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,570
oh, I'm sorry, it was on the bottom of that one.

650
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,290
I had a little bit of my screen in the way,

651
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,370
which I shall move.

652
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,530
For this client, they shipped the massive thing

653
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,410
because it was supposed to ship from a location

654
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,850
only 190 miles away from the client, excuse me,

655
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,850
140 miles and ended up shipping 814 miles.

656
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:57,930
That raised their shipping costs by $122

657
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:03,330
and lowered their net income by over 13%.

658
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:08,250
The product itself, the total sale is $900,

659
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:13,250
kind of to be expected when the shipping by itself is 122.

660
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:19,450
But in looking at all their sales over a period of time,

661
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,570
by not having inventory in the right place,

662
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,170
they've lost as much as $60,000.

663
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,290
And we're identifying that.

664
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,970
And then we can go into remediation phase

665
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,050
to recapture some of that lost net income.

666
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:41,050
And so stay tuned and talk to your CSM

667
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,890
if you'd be interested in bringing this into your house.

668
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:50,890
And that's the major new news for this new application.

669
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,690
And we look forward.

670
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,330
We think it's got a great look

671
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,770
and it's gonna be of great benefit to our clients.

672
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,250
Question and answer.

673
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,450
And thank you very much for submitting these.

674
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,810
Jason, you're gonna have to think

675
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,610
because they're gonna go all the way back to near the top.

676
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:17,610
How do I get the eBay delist relist tool?

677
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,600
How do you get it?

678
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,200
You let your CSM know you're interested.

679
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,400
You'll go through a quick survey

680
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,560
to evaluate the appropriate settings.

681
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Then the CSM will coordinate enabling those jobs

682
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,040
and you monitor the reports.

683
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,240
So how do you get it?

684
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,360
Technically, you already have it.

685
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,840
You just gotta work with your CSM

686
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,040
to get it up and running.

687
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,440
Okay, question number two.

688
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Is there an eBay automatic automature

689
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:03,490
to get more listings?

690
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,410
Say that one again.

691
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:10,410
Is there an eBay automature to get more listings?

692
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,610
So eBay's a marketplace where you're not competing.

693
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,810
So you cannot find other sellers

694
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,330
and attach to their eBay listing.

695
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:27,130
So there isn't a dynamic automature for eBay.

696
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:31,090
There is an eBay item creator which can create listings

697
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,090
under a certain publishing template

698
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,410
and get those listings on eBay,

699
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,010
but there isn't a automature

700
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,890
because you're not linking to other people's listings.

701
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,730
You would wanna leverage the item creator

702
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,890
to assess a supplier source or an ETL record

703
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,610
to create your own eBay listing.

704
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:54,610
Under order action rules,

705
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:59,610
can I use it to put new channel orders on hold

706
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,610
for a few hours while allowing for a cancellation window?

707
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,810
Absolutely, so an order action rule can be set up

708
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,210
for a channel, any order from that channel,

709
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:16,130
any order plus a skew from that channel.

710
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,690
And then you do have the option

711
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,690
to have a hold be automatically released

712
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,290
after a configured delay.

713
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,810
So you could definitely configure it

714
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,050
to hold the order for an hour or two

715
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,490
during the cancellation window

716
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,130
and then automatically release

717
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,410
for normal order fulfillment afterwards.

718
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,810
There was a question on monitoring.

719
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:46,810
Can a monitor be built to alert me

720
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:51,890
if a supplier inventory failed to load

721
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,810
or wasn't there to load at all?

722
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,680
I would assess that from an issue perspective.

723
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,480
Again, a issue is looking for a specific type of failure.

724
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,960
So bad credentials to an FTP

725
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,880
will cause a specific type of error.

726
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,240
No file being found will cause a specific type of error.

727
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,080
So you can get an alert from an issue

728
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,920
for supplier data imports.

729
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,280
Monitors would look at,

730
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,680
oh, the file size is greatly reduced

731
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,400
so that task isn't doing nearly as much as it was

732
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,000
or it's doing way more than it used to.

733
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,280
But the end goal there is you get alerted

734
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,000
when there's issues with inventory

735
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,440
that could be achieved, yes.

736
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,840
And if we don't answer any of these questions

737
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,760
to your satisfaction,

738
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,760
we're available to have a more direct and nuanced discussion

739
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,000
about what you're actually hoping to accomplish.

740
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
And this might be the last one

741
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,800
and I'm not really surprised that it showed up.

742
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,520
When will the web UI be released?

743
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,080
And can I use it for my customer service team?

744
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,440
I think we're gonna be doing this pretty much

745
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,080
on a one-off basis where we work with you

746
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,080
to see if the elements that we've already migrated over

747
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,680
fit your actual use case.

748
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,560
Clearly when you're in the legacy system,

749
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,560
you can go from here to there to there to there.

750
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,760
Right now, since we're moving over very discreet functions,

751
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,280
we wanna make sure that your use fits within what's migrated

752
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,320
so that they're not bouncing between systems.

753
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,400
But yeah, probably early third quarter,

754
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,360
maybe even late this quarter,

755
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,520
we can start having meaningful discussions

756
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,440
about if you're really interested,

757
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,440
we're gonna sound like a broken record,

758
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,820
please work with your CSM.

759
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,660
I covered all these topics at a high level

760
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,700
to get through them, make you aware of them.

761
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,060
I encourage getting your CSM on the line

762
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,320
to discuss your specific use needs.

763
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,500
But we isolated these features

764
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,780
because they are important to know about.

765
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,860
And again, we built them over years of working

766
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,460
with various customers in the e-commerce space

767
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,780
and found that these types of tools are needed

768
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:45,790
for the various business conditions that occur.

769
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,670
And if there's no more questions and I'm monitoring right now,

770
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,390
we're gonna start talking about next month.

771
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:58,390
Next month, it will be on the second Wednesday of the month.

772
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:02,070
I know we're on the third, that's our fault.

773
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,950
We didn't get the email out in time,

774
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,430
we didn't get the landing page out in time

775
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:11,550
and we decided that rather than doing a half bad job,

776
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,390
we would just push it off a week.

777
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,310
I'm glad you were able to attend,

778
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,690
but it is the second Wednesday of the month.

779
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:24,430
And the banner at the bottom represents last month,

780
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,470
we sent out a survey shortly after the webinar,

781
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:33,090
giving you three choices for this month, May.

782
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,890
And there's the results on the bottom.

783
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:39,650
This was the topic that you wanted to hear about

784
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,850
by a wide margin.

785
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:46,850
So once again, we will send out a survey, it will go to you.

786
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:52,170
If you respond, you have the ability to tell us

787
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,210
what is most important for next month.

788
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,200
And that's what the topic will be.

789
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,640
If I don't get another question in the next few seconds,

790
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,520
I'm gonna say we're gonna wrap up a few minutes early

791
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,440
and say, thank you, thanks for coming.

792
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,240
Our goal is to make you a better merchant,

793
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,880
a more knowledgeable merchant,

794
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,320
both about the marketplaces and about EVP

795
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:28,320
so that you can absolutely impact your success

796
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,800
and get things even going better, faster, bigger, higher.

797
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,600
Thank you.

798
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,440
Thank you.
