WEBVTT

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:07.769
Well, thank you for joining.

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.769
Here we are at the May edition of Tech Edge,

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.730
the ETail Solutions webinar series

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.649
for our clients on how to better utilize

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:24.649
and get more value out of their EVP instance.

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:29.769
With you again this month are myself, Jeff Burkard.

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.710
I'm a partner success manager here,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.490
and you may be tired of looking at his face,

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:38.390
but for the third month in a row,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.810
James Davis is our subject matter expert.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.810
James is well-versed in all aspects of the software,

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:51.090
and it is a little bit of a coincidence

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.210
that he has been the subject matter expert for the first three.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.409
I guarantee you that you will be seeing some new,

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.069
fresher, and better looking faces over the coming months.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:10.069
This month is a subject that you picked

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:15.349
by filling out the survey at the end of last month's session,

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.349
10 features that you need to grow your business,

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:24.189
and 10 features that will help automate your business

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.549
and make it easier to run.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.189
And the whole idea is,

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.189
how can we make you more efficient doing the basic things

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.590
so that you can focus on higher value things

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.430
that actually can move the needle for your business?

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.430
So without too much more introduction,

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.629
James, it's your show.

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:58.349
Yeah, so here are the topics we're gonna run through.

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.670
Again, I'm gonna spend about a minute to two minutes

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.829
on each topic.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.709
As always, if there's one topic that interests you,

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.349
contact your CSM about it,

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.710
and you can engage in a more in-depth discussion

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.569
about how it can apply to your environment specifically.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.710
Also, please, oh, go ahead.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.490
Put those questions in so that we can address them.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.270
Some of them will be right if they're very specific

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.069
to one of these 10 topics while we're in it,

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.949
we'll address it.

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.629
Otherwise, we'll roll back at the end

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.469
during our Q&A session.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.990
As always, please fill out the survey

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.870
that we send after the webinar

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.150
so we can get your feedback to improve these

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.550
and make sure that the topics are relevant

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.389
for what you guys are looking for.

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.509
And finally, the webinars are recorded

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.830
and available on the Help Center,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.949
which you can access via a link

00:02:54.949 --> 00:03:00.080
at the top of where you're creating tickets.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.840
After I cover these 10 topics,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.439
Jeff has got a surprise bonus topic

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.639
that will be, it's very interesting.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.439
I'm excited about the stuff he's covering

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.139
and rolling that out to some of you guys

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.680
over the next two quarters.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:13.819
We'll have Q&A,

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.680
and then we'll talk about the next Tech Edge.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.479
As always, ETails' mission is to drive growth and profits

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.000
for you guys through the platform.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.759
So again, these tools we are going to cover today

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.280
have been developed over a number of years

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.840
as we have solved problems for our clients,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.340
turning them into tools to be leveraged by others.

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.800
And so the first tool I'm going to cover

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.800
is the Amazon Competitive Analysis tool.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.919
This has its own screen with an EVP

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.000
and is an Amazon Market Assessment tool.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
What it allows you to do is take a list of potential SKUs

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.680
with identifying information such as UPC or part number,

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.039
search those SKUs on Amazon,

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:02.319
and get results and information about potential ASINs.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.719
So I can see and make a determination on,

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:08.400
is it worth investing to sell this product?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.599
Can I compete?

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.000
What will my estimated profit margins be?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.639
What are the buy box prices looking like?

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.680
These are all data points you would get

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.319
from the Competitive Analysis tool.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:23.040
You can also see, hey, no one's selling this ASIN

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.399
or selling this SKU under this UPC,

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.399
so there's potential there to create it.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.120
The main function of this tool is to assess,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.879
can I be competitive on Amazon?

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.439
What does the market look like for this particular product set?

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:41.480
The most common use of this tool

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.079
is I have a supplier reach out

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:46.519
or I'm looking at a potential supplier.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.480
I can get their catalog information,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.680
run it through this tool and make an evaluation

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.160
on whether or not I can compete.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.639
You may make a business decision,

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.160
hey, we're going to integrate this supplier,

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.360
but we're not going to worry about Amazon,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.879
or you can make the decision, hey, I can't.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.839
Amazon's my driver of most of my revenue.

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:07.800
This SKU, this catalog of SKUs

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.439
is going to be very difficult to compete,

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.759
so it doesn't make sense to move forward.

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.759
Again, this tool helps you analyze

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.360
the market conditions on Amazon for specific products

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.639
to make a determination on, could I compete?

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.339
Should I get involved in that market for that SKU?

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.740
The next tool I'm talking about is dynamic restrictions.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.699
Dynamic restrictions are located on the catalog module.

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.339
They have their own screen here.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.379
It's a listing management tool

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:42.220
that allows you to prevent the creation of SKUs

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.819
that meet certain conditions.

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.180
Again, I've brought up selection criteria

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.420
during each webinar.

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:50.019
It's used again here.

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:53.579
If an item meets a certain set of conditions,

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:58.420
then it will be restricted on the configured channels.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.459
Again, I can have multiple restrictions

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:02.779
of various conditions and channels,

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.699
but what it does is it prevents that,

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.579
prevents those SKUs from getting published,

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:10.899
so you can not have to worry

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:13.180
about getting marketplace violations,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.660
brand pull-down notices, things of that nature.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.180
If you create a restriction

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.420
and the system finds active listings

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:23.699
that match that restriction,

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.540
it will attempt to disable it and pull it down.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.379
We're optimizing that feature set,

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:32.500
so right now I would make sure to manually check

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.579
so that everything's pulled down successfully,

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:37.540
but that is the action that is attempted to take.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.459
It is dependent on the marketplace,

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:42.459
how far down we can delist it,

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:44.980
but at a minimum it should start publishing zero,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.819
which will prevent you

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.779
from selling on restricted marketplaces.

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:52.259
Again, you can enable this per channel.

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:55.660
You can create restrictions that affect multiple channels,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.699
but you can get very granular in controlling

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.220
where I do and do not create listings.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.779
This will affect listing creation processes

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:07.579
like the dynamic automature and the item creators

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:09.459
will work in tandem with this tool and know,

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:11.620
okay, I'm creating listings,

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.620
but this item's restricted, so I'm not gonna create it.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.540
Most common usages of this feature

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.779
are manufacturer restrictions,

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:24.220
you're onboarding a new supplier,

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.300
but you know certain brands can only be sold

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.300
on your own website,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.740
so you need to restrict them from third-party marketplaces.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.699
You may also sell hazardous material or liquids

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:37.699
and certain marketplaces don't want to

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:42.699
or the business expense of those orders is too great,

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.500
so I wanna restrict them,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.259
but again, if you can think of business scenarios

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:48.980
where you need to make sure

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.339
you're not selling certain products in certain places,

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.500
the dynamic restriction tool

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.420
should certainly be leveraged there.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:03.540
James, if I'm bringing in a new catalog

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:08.579
and there's a whole manufacturer that I can't sell,

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:12.300
when using the catalog source,

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.139
should I restrict it at the time of importing

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:20.259
or filter it out or do it with dynamic restrictions?

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.339
What Jeff's asking is if I got a new catalog

00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:26.259
and I know part of it's restricted,

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:28.180
when I create the supplier record,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.860
should I just filter those out and not create them at all?

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.980
It's really a business decision

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.220
on whether you think you're gonna be able

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.220
to sell those things in the future.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.980
You can certainly add checks

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.899
in the catalog source creation tool

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:45.580
to prevent those listings from being created.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.259
I would add a dynamic restriction

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:50.139
as you know, a double safety in that condition,

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:52.740
but you can restrict it at the catalog source level,

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.340
but if you think there's potential to sell it in the future,

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.580
I would encourage creating the supplier records

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.820
and leveraging the dynamic restriction tool.

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:04.259
Got it.

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:06.580
The third feature that you should be aware about

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.539
and be aware about is the eBay D-List ReList tool.

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:13.299
This is a listing publication optimization tool

00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:18.299
that promotes the freshness of eBay listings.

00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:21.139
60% of eBay's revenue comes from listings

00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:22.820
that they see as fresh.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.899
Their indexer optimizes those for visibility.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.340
We've had information provided us through various sources

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.419
that after seven days, a listing starts to get suppressed

00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:36.379
and after 14 days, it's completely buried.

00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:39.299
What impacts freshness is sort of like

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:41.220
the buy box algorithm, there's ideas,

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.179
but obviously it's proprietary,

00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:47.019
but things like cost changes, adding new images,

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:50.899
title changes all seem to promote the freshness

00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:53.379
of a listing which improve its visibility.

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:56.059
Another key aspect is it's on eBay,

00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:57.659
you have an eBay item ID.

00:09:57.659 --> 00:09:59.899
How old is that item ID?

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:03.620
After a certain age, again, eBay has indicated

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.659
that they suppress it.

00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:08.019
So getting a new fresh eBay item ID

00:10:08.019 --> 00:10:11.139
can help promote listing visibility on eBay.

00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:14.539
What the eBay D-List ReList tool does for you

00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:16.779
is you set various parameters

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:19.659
about how many I wanna re-list and de-list

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.220
and the system does it for you.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.460
We'll take a listing down, republish it,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.500
that will give it a new item ID

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.980
and then the idea is that increases its freshness

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.019
promoting its visibility.

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:36.460
We've implemented this tool in a number of clients

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.220
and we've seen an increase in eBay revenue.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.299
So again, I encourage you to reach out to your CSM

00:10:41.299 --> 00:10:44.779
so we can configure this and implement it.

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:48.779
We have various reports to show the impact it's made.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:51.179
We are working on a refinement

00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:54.740
to allow the system to be smart enough

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.620
to know when reinsertion fees start to be incurred

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.779
and throttle the re-listing.

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:01.580
So right now, if you do enable it,

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.779
you'll wanna be aware of your eBay account listing limits

00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:07.659
so that you don't incur insertion fees

00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:10.100
after you've reached your allotted amount.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.940
But again, this tool is very powerful

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.299
in helping drive sales on eBay

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:16.940
and keep your listings fresh so that they're visible.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.580
We kinda know that eBay

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.019
is probably not your number one marketplace anymore

00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:28.019
unless you're in a very specific catalog automotive typically

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.899
but we're always looking for ways

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:35.220
that can increase the growth,

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.940
find ways that other people aren't finding to help you grow.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.940
And we're gonna try and package these different services,

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.940
couple different eBay things that can juice your sales

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.340
into a package to make it easy to go for you to say,

00:11:55.539 --> 00:11:56.860
I know it's not big,

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.460
but I wanna see if I can boost it by 10, 15, 20%

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.059
my eBay business.

00:12:02.059 --> 00:12:05.220
So talk to your CSMs.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.340
Yeah, well, to build off of that,

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.460
we've got a number of eBay enhancement tools

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.659
that we've kind of packaged together

00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:17.179
related to re-pricing, this re-list,

00:12:17.179 --> 00:12:19.259
delisting, air management.

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:21.860
And so again, reach out to your CSM

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.860
to see how we can deploy that trifecta of features

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:31.960
to your eBay environment to try and promote sales.

00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:33.799
The fourth topic I'm covering today

00:12:33.799 --> 00:12:36.279
is order action rules and tags.

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:39.000
Order action rules and tags are an order management tool.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.879
It allows the sales order screen

00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:46.320
to work for you, not against you.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.840
What the order action rules do

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.600
is it creates automated behavior based on order conditions.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.120
So you can see here,

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.279
it's its own type of selection criteria

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.519
but it functions in the very same way.

00:12:57.519 --> 00:13:01.259
If an order meets the conditions, we can take an action.

00:13:01.259 --> 00:13:03.899
One of the actions you can take is you can add a tag.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.500
There's an unlimited number of tags you can have.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.139
Obviously you don't want too many

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:12.100
but as they lose their function,

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.299
but you can add a tag.

00:13:14.299 --> 00:13:15.539
When an order meets a condition

00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:16.779
and on the sales order screen,

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:19.700
I can filter on all orders that have that tag.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.500
One tag I've seen clients use

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.299
is any order over a hundred pounds.

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:24.539
I want a tag added to it

00:13:24.539 --> 00:13:26.539
so I can filter on those orders.

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.220
Any order with expedited shipping,

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.379
I want a tag added to it

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:31.059
so I can filter on those orders.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.700
There are other actions you can take.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.019
You can assign a service level.

00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:39.460
Any order that comes in for this SKU on Shopify,

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.139
I want to make sure it ships next day air

00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:46.179
because I'm having a promotion or something of that nature.

00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:49.019
You can also put orders on hold for a period of time

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:50.820
or until they're manually released.

00:13:51.679 --> 00:13:54.740
This is a big one for the automotive space.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.139
If I'm selling spark plugs,

00:13:56.139 --> 00:13:57.940
I want to make sure the pack quantity is right

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.379
or if I'm selling a bumper,

00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:02.419
I want to make sure that my shipping cost is covered.

00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:05.299
So again, think about the business conditions

00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:07.220
that you would like to try and capture

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.860
as we pull in orders

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.740
and work with your CSM to set up order action rules

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.200
to optimize your fulfillment workflow.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.620
There's a variety of conditions we can identify

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.419
and a number of actions we can take.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.799
Again, the tags allow for order grouping

00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:27.690
and optimized filtering on the sales results screen.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.889
And I discussed some of these common usages,

00:14:29.889 --> 00:14:32.929
but the best method is to think about the business scenario,

00:14:32.929 --> 00:14:34.529
engage with your CSM,

00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:36.269
and they can work towards setting up

00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:43.620
multiple order action rules that work for you.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.779
On one of our previous webinars,

00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:49.620
we covered the re-pricing at a 101 level,

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.220
and I had discussed the re-pricing results screen.

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:56.460
Specifically on the re-pricing results screen,

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.059
the buy box percent delta can be very powerful

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:02.860
for re-pricing assessment.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.779
What it allows you to do is look at your price

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:08.379
and how far away you are from the buy box.

00:15:08.379 --> 00:15:10.539
So if I'm within 5% of the buy box,

00:15:10.539 --> 00:15:12.740
there may be potential for me to compete.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.980
I want to assign those items to a rule with a lower floor

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.220
or one that seeks down more aggressively

00:15:19.059 --> 00:15:21.019
because there's potential, I'm pretty close.

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:22.980
If I can get my price down a little bit,

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.980
I can compete with the buy box.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.500
On the flip side, I can look at items

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.340
that are so far from the buy box,

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.019
they're not even close, 20% away, 15% away.

00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:38.340
And I can think about those SKUs strategically.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.899
Do I kit and bundle them and create a new ASIN?

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:44.500
Do I white label them or do I just kind of, you know,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.059
cut my losses and leave them as they are?

00:15:47.059 --> 00:15:50.820
But again, it gives you visibility on groups of SKUs

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.460
and how close you are to competing for the buy box price.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.220
And then make strategic decisions

00:15:56.259 --> 00:15:58.980
about what pricing strategies you want to apply

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.580
to those items.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.019
Again, a very powerful,

00:16:02.019 --> 00:16:04.539
the re-pricing results screen has a lot of potential,

00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:06.779
but this is definitely a filter you should utilize

00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:10.139
when you're looking at your Amazon re-pricing results.

00:16:11.419 --> 00:16:13.899
I think when a lot of you look at

00:16:13.899 --> 00:16:16.559
your very, very large catalogs,

00:16:19.299 --> 00:16:21.820
even the ones that you don't sell often,

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.740
and more importantly,

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.220
the ones that you literally have

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.980
as a consultant six months to a year,

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.740
why are we dealing with those on a daily basis?

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.740
They take time away from your top 10 or 20% of your products.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.100
Focus on what makes you money.

00:16:42.139 --> 00:16:47.139
One usage of this filter client identified the listings

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.659
that were really, really out of,

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:52.240
he had an inability to compete,

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:54.860
but he knew they were hot sellers,

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.620
so he worked with his supplier to buy them in bulk

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.740
at a reduced cost so he could get into that.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.179
Oh, that's great.

00:17:02.259 --> 00:17:03.580
He didn't drop ship the item

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.180
because the supplier wasn't gonna do it at that cost,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.019
but he was able to go,

00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:08.700
hey, this item sells,

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.980
but I need it at this cost so I can compete.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.180
He worked out a deal with his supplier

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.980
and he was able to start competing on that buy box.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.579
But again, this is an assessment tool

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.019
that gives you visibility on,

00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:21.059
hey, these SKUs,

00:17:21.059 --> 00:17:23.220
I need to apply this strategy

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.579
on these really uncompetitive SKUs.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.619
I need to either acknowledge that I'm ignoring them

00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:30.539
or apply a creative strategy.

00:17:30.539 --> 00:17:33.279
Again, I encourage hits and bundling

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:35.380
because you can create your own ASIN off of that

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.240
and then you're the only seller.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.380
So find products that pair together well

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.640
that aren't competitive on their own.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.759
Number six, many of you may be familiar with this tool,

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:50.119
but it is very important to be aware of what it can do

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:51.799
and the actions it can take.

00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:54.119
The bulk updater is a listing management tool

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:57.559
that allows bulk changes and forced actions.

00:17:57.559 --> 00:17:59.259
They're listed on the screen.

00:18:00.119 --> 00:18:02.119
There's some trees down each option.

00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:03.599
So I'd be familiar with them,

00:18:03.599 --> 00:18:06.720
but you can do things like force a price calculation,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.500
force publishing, change listing status, check restrictions.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.680
I've just added a new dynamic restriction.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.400
I select all my Amazon listings, check restriction.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.799
It'll start that process of,

00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:21.380
hey, these listings need to be restricted and publish zero.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.220
I'm shipping policy assignment.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.859
I've just added a new shipping template to eBay.

00:18:26.859 --> 00:18:29.660
I need to make sure these items that want to use it

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.960
are assigned to it, I can do that assessment.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.960
One activity I always encourage is isolate items and error

00:18:40.599 --> 00:18:41.920
on a specific channel,

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.200
bulk update through existing bulk update force publication

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.000
and then check in 48 hour, 24 hours later

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.380
and see if any of the error message return.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.380
A lot of times those error messages just go away

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.400
and then you can isolate the reoccurring error messages.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.539
Another action, I have a group of listings.

00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:03.180
I want to make sure our pricing,

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.259
I can isolate them, do a force price calculation

00:19:06.259 --> 00:19:08.720
and a force price publishing.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.660
This can be good for new listings that you've just created.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.940
If you don't wanna wait for the background tasks to run,

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.259
you can kind of do it yourself here.

00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:20.259
So again, the bulk update tool has a lot of potential

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:23.099
and I encourage you to think about using it before.

00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:25.140
What I see a lot of times is people

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.980
export the sales listing screen,

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.559
import it with the catalog source

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:31.579
to do some sort of manipulation that they could have achieved

00:19:31.579 --> 00:19:33.900
with the bulk update, saving them some time.

00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:37.859
You should also be aware you can update attribute values

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:42.779
with the bulk update tool for multiple listings.

00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:45.220
So if I'm using the re-pricing class attribute,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.259
for example, and I wanna change that,

00:19:47.259 --> 00:19:49.619
I can select the listings on the screen

00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:54.299
and do a bulk update.

00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:57.940
Number seven is attribute and category mapping.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.880
Attribute and category mapping allows you

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.579
to leverage your catalog data across multiple channels.

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:07.859
So often you will have a content rich channel,

00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:09.460
whether that's a content channel

00:20:10.779 --> 00:20:15.299
that's sort of a PIM integration or a content channel

00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:18.500
like a eBay or Shopify where you've spent

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.619
probably hours building your own repertoire of content.

00:20:22.539 --> 00:20:24.299
Or you've taken content for Amazon,

00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:27.980
but you have a good source channel and you wanna go,

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.380
okay, on eBay, I need to provide my own content.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.940
So I'm gonna take information from my content rich channel

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.140
and I'm gonna move it onto eBay.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.779
On the screen, you can see an example.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:41.059
I'm taking the material attribute from Amazon

00:20:43.819 --> 00:20:45.539
from the supplier.

00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:49.019
So my source is the supplier and that attribute is material

00:20:49.019 --> 00:20:53.299
and I'm using it to populate the fabric attribute on Amazon.

00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:55.259
So I don't have to go into the Amazon listing

00:20:55.259 --> 00:20:56.980
and add an attribute so it has fabric.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.380
It's leveraging my already present data.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.539
This can also apply to categories.

00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:06.940
A major area to leverage this is for Walmart,

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.940
which doesn't have a native category assignment tool.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.380
So I always encourage my clients to go,

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.059
my eBay categories are good or my Shopify categories are good.

00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:20.059
Go up to this category mapping tool and it allows you to say,

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:24.059
hey, if this SKU is on Shopify in this category,

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:26.059
put it in this category on Walmart.

00:21:26.059 --> 00:21:29.299
And this can help optimize category assignment,

00:21:29.299 --> 00:21:31.859
which ultimately results in better search results

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:35.259
as people will go down the search trees of certain categories

00:21:35.259 --> 00:21:36.299
and find your product.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.019
Another place to leverage this is the eBay required attribute,

00:21:41.019 --> 00:21:45.660
required attributes, certain categories require certain attributes.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.779
You can find a pattern of common ones, color, size, type,

00:21:51.779 --> 00:21:54.779
find a source for that data, map it to eBay,

00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:58.259
and that addresses that error and prevents it from occurring.

00:21:58.259 --> 00:22:02.500
So again, it's a tool to maximize your content

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:07.859
across your various marketplaces.

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:11.660
Number eight, next best fulfillment is an order management tool

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.660
that allows you to find the second best solution.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.420
It isn't enabled by default,

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.619
so you would need to work with your CSM.

00:22:18.619 --> 00:22:20.900
It's just as simple as checking a checkbox,

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.019
but then you'll see this next best option

00:22:23.019 --> 00:22:27.849
on the change fulfillment method screen.

00:22:27.849 --> 00:22:30.450
Common usages of this feature

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.690
are routing around bad quantity data.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.769
The suppliers let me know their inventory feeds inaccurate.

00:22:35.769 --> 00:22:37.369
The system doesn't know that.

00:22:37.369 --> 00:22:40.930
I need to take this group of orders and route them elsewhere.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.849
Or I know that a distribution center

00:22:43.849 --> 00:22:46.329
is having a temporary outage for a few hours

00:22:46.329 --> 00:22:48.250
and these expedited orders need to ship.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:52.490
So I select them, find the next best solution.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:56.210
And another scenario is I'm selling from my stock.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.450
I've got more orders than I can deal with.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.930
I need to make sure that these things

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.009
get shipped out on time.

00:23:01.009 --> 00:23:02.930
I know I can drop ship them,

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.089
select the orders I can't handle,

00:23:05.089 --> 00:23:07.609
and I send them to a secondary source.

00:23:07.609 --> 00:23:09.970
So again, it's a tool to leverage

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.650
when you're finding yourself

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.930
in need of a second best solution.

00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:18.690
It's a use case tool,

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.410
but it is powerful in helping you route orders

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.410
and deal with the complexity of order fulfillment

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.690
when the best solution is not working out

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:33.839
or can't handle the orders.

00:23:33.839 --> 00:23:37.000
Number nine is the item weight priority tool.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.680
What this tool does is it helps you manage your DIMM data

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.759
from various sources.

00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:44.680
It prioritizes and elevates them

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.880
to the master skew details page.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.599
So when you open a skew

00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:51.440
and you go to master skew details page

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.160
in the top corner, there's DIMM data.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.599
That data is used for estimated shipping.

00:23:57.599 --> 00:24:01.680
It's used for when we manifest shipping labels

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.279
and used in repricing.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.200
So you wanna make sure it's accurate

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.240
and of the highest quality.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.599
Now you may have initial DIMM data

00:24:10.599 --> 00:24:12.000
provided by the supplier,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.039
but as you ship stuff,

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:15.480
you get more accurate data into the system

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.799
and what the item weight priority tool lets you do

00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:22.160
is assess multiple sources of DIMM data,

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.519
prioritize them,

00:24:23.519 --> 00:24:26.960
and then slowly select from the best source available.

00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:30.519
This is important to have in place

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:32.160
if you're using native shipping.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.720
It's important to have in place

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.039
to get accurate estimated shipping costs.

00:24:37.039 --> 00:24:39.160
A big problem I see is suppliers

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.319
tell you how big the item is.

00:24:41.319 --> 00:24:42.880
So you have that DIMM data,

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.680
but that's not how big it is when it's in a box.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.880
So your estimated shipping's off.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.240
So as you aggregate better and better DIMM data,

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.240
you get better and better estimated shipping,

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.400
which means you can compete

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.319
and optimize your profitability.

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.720
The last area where this is...

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.640
Go ahead, John.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.319
Oh, I was just gonna say that

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.359
beyond your actual product cost,

00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:09.559
I think we're all starting to understand

00:25:09.559 --> 00:25:12.920
unless you are not operationally excellent

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.799
in the way you manage your shipping

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:18.279
and your weights and your DIMM weights

00:25:18.279 --> 00:25:20.680
and the way you work with your carriers

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.640
to get your estimates,

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.759
it is tough to make money.

00:25:24.759 --> 00:25:29.599
This is just another tool to better manage your costs

00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:31.559
to make sure that every shipment

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:34.440
that goes out the door is profitable.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.740
Another powerful tool that's been slowly rolling out

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.380
into EVP is cartonization.

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:47.900
And accurate DIMM data is key for cartonization.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.539
In a brief summary, cartonization allows you to say,

00:25:50.539 --> 00:25:53.740
I have these set of boxes, they cost me this much

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.380
and they're this big in terms of volume.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.660
The system then, when processing an order,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.740
goes, hey, this order has four SKUs,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.980
they'll all fit in this box, ship them in this box.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.980
Or you have four SKUs,

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.900
you're gonna have to use two boxes

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.980
because of the way the volume works out.

00:26:10.059 --> 00:26:12.619
And then you can optimize your order flow

00:26:12.619 --> 00:26:16.339
because the system's prompting the worker

00:26:16.339 --> 00:26:18.700
or the order fulfillment person,

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.859
hey, I don't need to think about what box to use,

00:26:20.859 --> 00:26:22.460
the system's telling me.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.500
And then the cost of that box

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.859
has worked into your profitability.

00:26:26.859 --> 00:26:30.059
So there's a lot of potential with cartonization

00:26:30.059 --> 00:26:33.460
that starts with leveraging quality DIMM data

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.140
and the item weight priority tool

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.420
is the mechanism to get there.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.900
And although cartonization will be probably

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.779
its own webinar topic in the future,

00:26:43.779 --> 00:26:47.059
that situation where it created two boxes,

00:26:47.059 --> 00:26:49.220
we can band those together

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.980
so that you only have one origination fee.

00:26:57.299 --> 00:26:59.980
Number 10, monitors and alerts.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.380
So as you're aware, we have background systems

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.420
monitoring the system performance at all times.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.059
We send out alerts periodically

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:10.619
when we notice disruptions in behavior,

00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:14.140
but you can also get visibility on your system performance

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.220
with these monitoring tools.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.859
Specifically with issues,

00:27:17.859 --> 00:27:20.940
you will see the issues screen below orders.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.900
It's under leveraged in my experience

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.819
with a lot of clients

00:27:23.819 --> 00:27:25.900
because there's so much information on it.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.740
It gives you listing errors, it gives you task errors,

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.420
it can be hard to digest.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.319
The solution to that is for you

00:27:36.319 --> 00:27:39.440
to work with your CSM and isolate important errors

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.359
to know about.

00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:45.359
A big one is inventory files failing to load from an FTP.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.759
That causes a very specific error that we track.

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:49.920
We will create an issue,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.480
but we can also send out email alerts to specific users.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.799
If you have a fulfillment manager

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:58.440
and orders are failing to send or import,

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.440
that's an error message we can track for

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.920
and email users about so that they're aware

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.200
that there's something going on with tasks

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.200
that needs to be addressed

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:13.009
that's preventing optimized order flow.

00:28:13.009 --> 00:28:14.970
Next, we have monitors.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.450
Monitors track overall task performance.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.809
So again, an issue is looking for a specific error message.

00:28:20.809 --> 00:28:24.730
Monitors track the average volume load of that task

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.450
and will note spikes in it.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:29.450
It will note task failures.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.250
There's more to come on monitors.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.769
We'll have a webinar session on it

00:28:32.769 --> 00:28:34.710
with our monitor, Smee, Aaron Peck.

00:28:37.329 --> 00:28:39.329
But again, talk to your CSM.

00:28:39.329 --> 00:28:41.210
I encourage you to leverage issues

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.650
and see where that can benefit your team

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.730
and then move on to looking at monitors.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.490
We are exposing that more and more.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.809
We have some customers setting up their own monitors,

00:28:50.809 --> 00:28:53.170
but again, work with your CSM,

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.490
focus on issue alerts first,

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.049
and then see where monitors might make sense for you as well.

00:28:59.049 --> 00:29:01.130
Those are my 10 topics.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.809
As noted in the agenda, Jeff, it's a surprise for us.

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:08.849
And now, drum roll, please,

00:29:08.849 --> 00:29:11.569
something that a lot of you've been asking for

00:29:11.569 --> 00:29:13.569
for a couple of years now,

00:29:13.569 --> 00:29:17.049
we are happy to announce that ETail

00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:19.930
is migrating to a browser.

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:24.930
We already have certain roles already migrated over,

00:29:25.769 --> 00:29:30.769
and this is in production use in some of our new clients.

00:29:32.049 --> 00:29:34.210
Today, the way we're migrating it,

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.769
we're taking roles and moving them over.

00:29:37.769 --> 00:29:41.890
So there still may be things that you need to do

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:46.730
in your traditional EVP legacy platform.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:51.730
There may be some things that you will always do in EVP.

00:29:51.849 --> 00:29:54.450
System admin kind of level functions

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:58.849
are some very high-end power user kind of functions.

00:29:58.849 --> 00:30:02.369
But for the people that just need to deal with the data

00:30:02.369 --> 00:30:04.930
to do their normal daily task,

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:08.569
a CSM on order management person,

00:30:08.569 --> 00:30:12.930
a somebody who handles the shipping and manifesting,

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:16.529
we're starting to roll out specific roles

00:30:16.529 --> 00:30:19.049
to some of our newer clients.

00:30:19.049 --> 00:30:22.329
And now we're gonna start talking to our current clients

00:30:22.329 --> 00:30:26.890
about are there potential areas of their business

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.970
they would like to roll out.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.769
Why don't we go to the next one?

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:36.849
And along with that, we are working on some functionality

00:30:36.849 --> 00:30:41.369
where we're gonna be offering a standalone product

00:30:41.369 --> 00:30:44.809
for new clients in the near future,

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:46.369
not formally announced yet.

00:30:46.369 --> 00:30:50.289
So hopefully all of you are under NDA,

00:30:50.289 --> 00:30:52.289
but we're calling it ideal order

00:30:52.289 --> 00:30:54.250
that we're on every single order.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.650
We're looking at, did it ship from the right location?

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:00.170
Was the right packaging used?

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.089
Was the right carrier used?

00:31:02.089 --> 00:31:04.769
Was the right service level used?

00:31:04.769 --> 00:31:07.009
Did all the documentation get included?

00:31:07.009 --> 00:31:08.250
Did it ship on time?

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.730
Did it arrive on time?

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:14.210
We're tracking all those individual items per order

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:18.410
to tell you if an order was ideal

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:22.250
and did it meet your profit goals for that order?

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.849
And we're calling that ideal order.

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:28.089
Next one, we'll even look at,

00:31:28.089 --> 00:31:30.569
oh, I'm sorry, it was on the bottom of that one.

00:31:30.569 --> 00:31:34.289
I had a little bit of my screen in the way,

00:31:34.289 --> 00:31:36.369
which I shall move.

00:31:36.369 --> 00:31:39.529
For this client, they shipped the massive thing

00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:43.410
because it was supposed to ship from a location

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:47.849
only 190 miles away from the client, excuse me,

00:31:47.849 --> 00:31:52.849
140 miles and ended up shipping 814 miles.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:57.930
That raised their shipping costs by $122

00:31:58.329 --> 00:32:03.329
and lowered their net income by over 13%.

00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:08.250
The product itself, the total sale is $900,

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:13.250
kind of to be expected when the shipping by itself is 122.

00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:19.450
But in looking at all their sales over a period of time,

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.569
by not having inventory in the right place,

00:32:22.569 --> 00:32:26.170
they've lost as much as $60,000.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.289
And we're identifying that.

00:32:28.289 --> 00:32:31.970
And then we can go into remediation phase

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:36.049
to recapture some of that lost net income.

00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:41.049
And so stay tuned and talk to your CSM

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:45.890
if you'd be interested in bringing this into your house.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:50.890
And that's the major new news for this new application.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.690
And we look forward.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:56.329
We think it's got a great look

00:32:56.329 --> 00:32:59.769
and it's gonna be of great benefit to our clients.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.250
Question and answer.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.450
And thank you very much for submitting these.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.809
Jason, you're gonna have to think

00:33:08.809 --> 00:33:12.609
because they're gonna go all the way back to near the top.

00:33:12.609 --> 00:33:17.609
How do I get the eBay delist relist tool?

00:33:20.759 --> 00:33:21.599
How do you get it?

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.200
You let your CSM know you're interested.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.400
You'll go through a quick survey

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.559
to evaluate the appropriate settings.

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:37.559
Then the CSM will coordinate enabling those jobs

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.039
and you monitor the reports.

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:42.240
So how do you get it?

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.359
Technically, you already have it.

00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:44.839
You just gotta work with your CSM

00:33:44.839 --> 00:33:46.039
to get it up and running.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.440
Okay, question number two.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.480
Is there an eBay automatic automature

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:03.490
to get more listings?

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:05.410
Say that one again.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:10.409
Is there an eBay automature to get more listings?

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:16.610
So eBay's a marketplace where you're not competing.

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.809
So you cannot find other sellers

00:34:19.809 --> 00:34:22.329
and attach to their eBay listing.

00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:27.130
So there isn't a dynamic automature for eBay.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:31.090
There is an eBay item creator which can create listings

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.090
under a certain publishing template

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:36.409
and get those listings on eBay,

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:38.010
but there isn't a automature

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:40.889
because you're not linking to other people's listings.

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:44.730
You would wanna leverage the item creator

00:34:44.809 --> 00:34:47.889
to assess a supplier source or an ETL record

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.610
to create your own eBay listing.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:54.610
Under order action rules,

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:59.610
can I use it to put new channel orders on hold

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:04.610
for a few hours while allowing for a cancellation window?

00:35:05.769 --> 00:35:09.809
Absolutely, so an order action rule can be set up

00:35:09.809 --> 00:35:13.210
for a channel, any order from that channel,

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.130
any order plus a skew from that channel.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.690
And then you do have the option

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:21.690
to have a hold be automatically released

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.289
after a configured delay.

00:35:23.289 --> 00:35:25.809
So you could definitely configure it

00:35:25.809 --> 00:35:28.050
to hold the order for an hour or two

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.489
during the cancellation window

00:35:30.489 --> 00:35:32.130
and then automatically release

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.409
for normal order fulfillment afterwards.

00:35:39.289 --> 00:35:41.809
There was a question on monitoring.

00:35:41.809 --> 00:35:46.809
Can a monitor be built to alert me

00:35:46.889 --> 00:35:51.889
if a supplier inventory failed to load

00:35:51.889 --> 00:35:55.809
or wasn't there to load at all?

00:36:01.679 --> 00:36:04.679
I would assess that from an issue perspective.

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:08.480
Again, a issue is looking for a specific type of failure.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.960
So bad credentials to an FTP

00:36:11.079 --> 00:36:13.880
will cause a specific type of error.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:20.239
No file being found will cause a specific type of error.

00:36:21.239 --> 00:36:25.079
So you can get an alert from an issue

00:36:26.599 --> 00:36:29.920
for supplier data imports.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.280
Monitors would look at,

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.679
oh, the file size is greatly reduced

00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:37.400
so that task isn't doing nearly as much as it was

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.000
or it's doing way more than it used to.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.280
But the end goal there is you get alerted

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.000
when there's issues with inventory

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.440
that could be achieved, yes.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.840
And if we don't answer any of these questions

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.760
to your satisfaction,

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.760
we're available to have a more direct and nuanced discussion

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.000
about what you're actually hoping to accomplish.

00:37:02.039 --> 00:37:04.039
And this might be the last one

00:37:04.039 --> 00:37:07.800
and I'm not really surprised that it showed up.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.519
When will the web UI be released?

00:37:11.519 --> 00:37:15.079
And can I use it for my customer service team?

00:37:15.079 --> 00:37:18.440
I think we're gonna be doing this pretty much

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.079
on a one-off basis where we work with you

00:37:21.079 --> 00:37:26.079
to see if the elements that we've already migrated over

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.679
fit your actual use case.

00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:33.559
Clearly when you're in the legacy system,

00:37:33.559 --> 00:37:38.559
you can go from here to there to there to there.

00:37:38.599 --> 00:37:42.760
Right now, since we're moving over very discreet functions,

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:47.280
we wanna make sure that your use fits within what's migrated

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.320
so that they're not bouncing between systems.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.400
But yeah, probably early third quarter,

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.360
maybe even late this quarter,

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.519
we can start having meaningful discussions

00:37:59.519 --> 00:38:02.440
about if you're really interested,

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.440
we're gonna sound like a broken record,

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:10.820
please work with your CSM.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.659
I covered all these topics at a high level

00:38:13.659 --> 00:38:16.699
to get through them, make you aware of them.

00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:21.059
I encourage getting your CSM on the line

00:38:21.059 --> 00:38:23.320
to discuss your specific use needs.

00:38:24.579 --> 00:38:27.500
But we isolated these features

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.780
because they are important to know about.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.860
And again, we built them over years of working

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.460
with various customers in the e-commerce space

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.780
and found that these types of tools are needed

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:45.789
for the various business conditions that occur.

00:38:45.789 --> 00:38:49.670
And if there's no more questions and I'm monitoring right now,

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:53.389
we're gonna start talking about next month.

00:38:53.389 --> 00:38:58.389
Next month, it will be on the second Wednesday of the month.

00:38:58.429 --> 00:39:02.070
I know we're on the third, that's our fault.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:03.949
We didn't get the email out in time,

00:39:03.949 --> 00:39:06.429
we didn't get the landing page out in time

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:11.550
and we decided that rather than doing a half bad job,

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:15.389
we would just push it off a week.

00:39:15.389 --> 00:39:17.309
I'm glad you were able to attend,

00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:20.690
but it is the second Wednesday of the month.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:24.429
And the banner at the bottom represents last month,

00:39:24.429 --> 00:39:28.469
we sent out a survey shortly after the webinar,

00:39:28.469 --> 00:39:33.090
giving you three choices for this month, May.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.889
And there's the results on the bottom.

00:39:35.909 --> 00:39:39.650
This was the topic that you wanted to hear about

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.849
by a wide margin.

00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:46.849
So once again, we will send out a survey, it will go to you.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:52.170
If you respond, you have the ability to tell us

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:56.210
what is most important for next month.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:40:00.199
And that's what the topic will be.

00:40:00.199 --> 00:40:04.639
If I don't get another question in the next few seconds,

00:40:04.639 --> 00:40:08.519
I'm gonna say we're gonna wrap up a few minutes early

00:40:08.519 --> 00:40:11.440
and say, thank you, thanks for coming.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:17.239
Our goal is to make you a better merchant,

00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:18.880
a more knowledgeable merchant,

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.320
both about the marketplaces and about EVP

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:28.320
so that you can absolutely impact your success

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.800
and get things even going better, faster, bigger, higher.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.599
Thank you.

00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:38.440
Thank you.
