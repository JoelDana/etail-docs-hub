## Quick Steps

1. Okay.
2. Okay.
3. Fantastic.
4. Okay.
5. Yeah.
6. And set up of a catalog source to import quantity.
7. And then set some goals for the next Tech Edge.
8. Available to everyone as a digital asset.
9. Is it's getting imported into EVP.
10. And set them up on your own,.
11. To do it for you, which allows you to set up,.
12. Because you're doing the work to set up 75% of it.
13. To import external data while also analyzing it.
14. And when you're importing data,.
15. Created, took 350 of those dropship suppliers.
16. You apply mappings, you add mappings to the catalog source.
17. And what a mapping is, is a bridge.
18. So you build those mappings, you then analyze and validate.
19. The analyze and validate step looks at the external data.
20. Runs through any analysis mappings you have,.
21. Then you apply the maps.
22. Applying the maps builds that bridge.
23. That you've kind of outlined in setting up the mappings.
24. When I click step four and import this data,.
25. Is you can preview the behavior of the import.
26. And then lastly, you can import the data.
27. You set up an automation so we can regularly import things.
28. Like cost updates, quantity, new images, stuff like that.
29. You go to the catalog module.
30. And then you go to catalog sources.
31. You can create a new catalog source up here.
32. You can create them from marketplaces.
33. So in this case, I'm gonna create a new one.
34. And I'm gonna select from a file.
35. Being kept updated,.
36. So I select the file.
37. So I'm gonna hit save.
38. The same as the file you used to create it.
39. Once you've created the initial catalog source,.
40. They submit tickets, hey, inventory didn't update.
41. I didn't need to reach out or create a support ticket.
42. And you establish your mappings.
43. Again, a mapping is a bridge.
44. With all of the mapping options you have available.
45. Getting familiar with these mapping options.
46. Once you've set up your mappings,.
47. You're gonna save and close and reopen the catalog source.
48. Now on the mappings tab, you will see your mappings.
49. One mapping I wanna call out,.
50. You can change the map type to a custom script.
51. You can manipulate it as you're importing it.
52. So once you've set up your mappings,.
53. There is an analysis mapping option.
54. I don't wanna import it.
55. I've identified an issue before I've imported it.
56. How do formatting map errors alert you?
57. Determines something's invalid, does it get imported?
58. And it doesn't let you import that invalid UPC.
59. If you don't have a mapping for a field,.
60. It's not imported.
61. And I'm just importing the quantity by matching on this view.
62. We're actually gonna try and apply the maps.
63. That we've set up and build that bridge.
64. So when apply maps,.
65. Before you import,.
66. Or do I have potential SKUs I can create?
67. And have them help you fix it,.
68. So once you've applied the maps,.
69. This screen here is exportable.
70. And can be exported into Excel.
71. So you can kind of filter out,.
72. After it's applied the maps,.
73. I'm gonna cover the settings really quick.
74. Is the create and update.
75. Do I wanna create or update master SKUs?
76. Then do I wanna create or update channel records?
77. But again, if I need to create a channel record,.
78. So, but this will control how we update.
79. Or create master SKUs and SKUs.
80. So as I applied map, we're almost done there.
81. You're importing it to a catalog source,.
82. You're establishing your mappings,.
83. You're applying your mappings and analyzing the results.
84. And then you're importing the data.
85. Is once you've set it up, you can automate it.
