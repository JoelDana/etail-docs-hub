1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,700
I would like to thank you all for attending

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,760
the first Tech Edge that ETail is sponsoring.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,520
This is gonna become a monthly webinar series

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,420
to help you guys grow your business.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,960
I hope you're seeing that we're trying to make this

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,640
a new ETail with higher engagement,

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,080
more focus on what's gonna help you

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,780
run your business better, grow your business,

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,000
and hopefully grow it more profitably.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,420
It will be, we're gonna cover this at the end,

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,100
but it is gonna be every month,

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,180
the second Wednesday of the month.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,540
And we'll be talking about new features, new modules.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,000
Very possibly we'll be talking about topics

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,420
that you ask us to talk about.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,300
So mark it on your calendars now.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,740
1 p.m. East Coast, noon central,

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,120
and 10 a.m. West Coast time,

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,480
and 11 a.m. for the mountain people

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,480
will be the monthly ETail e-commerce Tech Edge

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,120
hosted by me, Jeff Burkhardt.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,200
And every month I will have a new

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,640
or the appropriate subject matter expert with me.

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,460
And with that, we're off.

25
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,830
One thing I think that we need to talk about more internally,

26
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,790
although we bring this up at every company meeting,

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,590
which we hold monthly,

28
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,930
is there's only one reason why we're really here.

29
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,910
And it is to help you guys grow

30
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,190
and really focus on making sure that you grow profitably.

31
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,270
That is the only use for our platform

32
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,630
is to help you drive your business.

33
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,010
And we're gonna find ways to enable you

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,770
to do that more efficiently,

35
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,890
find ways for you to do that,

36
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,330
not necessarily asking us to do everything for you,

37
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,250
but educating you and helping you use the system better.

38
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,730
So with that in mind,

39
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,490
I am your host.

40
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,490
And with me today is one of the many, many, many Davises

41
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,110
that we have in the organization, James.

42
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,830
James was gonna actually wanted to get a question

43
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,830
on the poll, which we'll be showing at the end of the,

44
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,150
at the end of the session,

45
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,710
there will be a survey for you to fill out.

46
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,150
And one of the questions is,

47
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,030
is James better in a comb-over or a better ball?

48
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,970
So you have your two options on the screen

49
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,850
to take a look at right now,

50
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,290
please vote at the end in the survey at the end.

51
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,970
Today, we're gonna be talking about catalog source.

52
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,970
How this tool effectively and efficiently

53
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,230
helps you get new data sources into ETL

54
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,450
in a safe, automated way very quickly.

55
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,530
Future sessions, the sky's the limit.

56
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,310
What do you wanna learn about?

57
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,110
We have a full laundry list of things

58
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,410
that we wanna talk about

59
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,770
on the second Wednesday of every month,

60
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,910
but we've polled our internal team.

61
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,490
Is it pricing?

62
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:39,490
Is it taking the next layer down in catalog source?

63
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,370
Or is there a topic that you want us to talk about

64
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,290
and we're gonna listen.

65
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,190
We're gonna get much better at listening.

66
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,550
God gave us two ears and one mouth for a very good reason.

67
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,370
So once again, thank you for coming.

68
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,910
And now James, can you talk about the agenda

69
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,350
just for a minute or two?

70
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,130
Yeah, so we did a little intro

71
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,910
to the webinar series in the house, me and Joe.

72
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,630
The next slide, I'm gonna spend some time

73
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,430
talking about what is a catalog source

74
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,890
and why you should care,

75
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,170
give you some example usages.

76
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,830
After that, we're going to go through a basic use case

77
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,890
and set up of a catalog source to import quantity.

78
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,850
Then we will look at various applications

79
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,690
of the catalog source,

80
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,050
where it can be utilized,

81
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,010
what it's used for in various business scenarios,

82
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,490
have some time for Q and A

83
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,310
and then set some goals for the next Tech Edge

84
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,750
and do a poll on the next topics

85
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,130
and wrap it up from there.

86
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:01,390
One thing I wanna add is we're gonna make this video

87
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,310
available to everyone as a digital asset.

88
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,710
You'll be getting a link to it

89
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,270
so that you can either rewatch it yourself

90
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,510
or share with other teammates that maybe couldn't make today.

91
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,470
We are aware that the second Wednesday of March

92
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,890
happened to be a Jewish holiday

93
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,550
and we still wanted to go forward with this date,

94
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,550
but we do understand that those that are very strong

95
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,470
in their faith maybe can't make it today.

96
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,750
So we are gonna make it available and please sit down.

97
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,790
We're actually gonna provide documentation

98
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,310
to go along with this.

99
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,960
James is gonna go a little bit more at a very high level

100
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,640
over some of the use cases for catalog source

101
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,660
and then we'll get into more visual representation

102
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,620
of what you do.

103
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,860
So I picked the catalog sources and initial topic to work on

104
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,160
because it is the main tool

105
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,400
to manage your catalog content,

106
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,400
whether that's rich attribute data or quantity or pricing,

107
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,220
but it is the main tool to handle external data

108
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,640
is it's getting imported into EVP

109
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,540
and a lot of the functions you can achieve

110
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,640
with catalog source, if you can manage

111
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,460
and set them up on your own,

112
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,600
you can eliminate the need to get your CSM

113
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,540
to do it for you, which allows you to set up,

114
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,140
for example, a supplier at a much reduced cost

115
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,080
because you're doing the work to set up 75% of it

116
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,380
with the catalog source.

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,560
Again, the catalog source is a tool

118
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,980
to import external data while also analyzing it

119
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,140
and doing some checks and balances.

120
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,800
Obviously your EVP catalog is,

121
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,740
you want that to be very clean and organized

122
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,580
and when you're importing data,

123
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,820
historically it could be very easy to mess up your catalog

124
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,220
with the catalog source tool.

125
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,220
That's not as much of a risk.

126
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,500
It's designed to handle flat files,

127
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,120
CSV, XML, text.

128
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,720
We do work with APIs that build files,

129
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,200
but again, I have external data I need to deal with

130
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,320
and I want it in my system to be utilized somehow.

131
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,960
This is the tool you want to know,

132
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,660
be very familiar with so you can deal

133
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,100
with that business scenario.

134
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,400
I know that a while back we had a client

135
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,280
that literally had hundreds and hundreds

136
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,740
of non-integrated dropship suppliers

137
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,500
and during their implementation time period,

138
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,500
they got up to speed on catalog source very, very quickly

139
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,460
and during their implementation period,

140
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,380
created, took 350 of those dropship suppliers

141
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,500
and turned them into fully integrated suppliers for themselves.

142
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,080
For the brands out there,

143
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,920
there are just as many reasons to use catalog source,

144
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,560
whether it's doing some additional content

145
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,000
or high quality content.

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,200
There's working with 3PL or fulfillment partners.

147
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,880
There are hundreds of uses for catalog source.

148
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,200
Some basic rundown of a catalog source usage scenario

149
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,880
is you get external data,

150
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,020
you load that data into a catalog source,

151
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,180
which I like to think of as a loading dock.

152
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,580
You apply mappings, you add mappings to the catalog source

153
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,340
and what a mapping is, is a bridge.

154
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,300
I'm saying this external data, I have this field

155
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,220
and that means this in EVP and you're building that linkage.

156
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,660
So if I have a skew in the external file,

157
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,420
I tell it that this is the channel skew in EVP

158
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,080
or if this attribute equates to this attribute

159
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,240
or this MPN is actually not the one in my system,

160
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,360
so I'm just gonna load it as an attribute.

161
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,740
So you build those mappings, you then analyze and validate.

162
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,280
The analyze and validate step looks at the external data

163
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,120
and checks that UPCs are valid,

164
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,720
runs through any analysis mappings you have,

165
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,640
which can do things like check if the price

166
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,460
is below a certain amount,

167
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,640
look for keywords and titles that need to be excluded.

168
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,140
But again, it's vetting the data bit.

169
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,260
Then you apply the maps.

170
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,580
Applying the maps builds that bridge

171
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,500
that you've kind of outlined in setting up the mappings

172
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,980
and links and attempts to link the external data

173
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,980
to an internal skew in EVP so that you have a clean bridge.

174
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,860
So you know ahead of time,

175
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,580
when I click step four and import this data,

176
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,040
I know where it's gonna go and what it's gonna do.

177
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,680
Again, that's the real power behind a catalog source

178
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,500
is you can preview the behavior of the import

179
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,000
before you do so,

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,440
so you're not scrambling to clean up something

181
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,680
if a column was off or whatnot.

182
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,720
And then lastly, you can import the data

183
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,160
and then if there's a need for it,

184
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,560
you set up an automation so we can regularly import things

185
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,560
like cost updates, quantity, new images, stuff like that.

186
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,860
And that all comes to play

187
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,960
when you automate the catalog source.

188
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,900
All right, get ready James.

189
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,740
I'm going to make you the new host

190
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:54,080
as soon as I hit the correct button again

191
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,360
and you have the ball.

192
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,330
So there you go.

193
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,250
As of right now, I don't see a lot of questions coming in.

194
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,770
When they do come in,

195
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,450
if they're pertinent to what we're covering right at this

196
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,550
moment, we may insert them in,

197
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,770
but we are gonna have a time near the end

198
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,970
where we can handle those questions.

199
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,750
Any questions that we don't get to

200
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,930
or any questions that are very, very specific

201
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,030
to maybe some catalog sources you're currently running

202
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,210
or very unique problems to something that you're doing,

203
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,050
please discuss with your CSM.

204
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,250
We're here, we're here to help

205
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,090
and we're on the line to kind of understand

206
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,570
what are our clients thinking

207
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:47,760
and how can we help them better utilize this tool?

208
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Yes, and again, our goal here is to pique your interest,

209
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,820
give you some surface level details.

210
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,460
The documentation I've written up

211
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,880
goes into a bit more detail.

212
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,180
But again, this is to get you thinking about

213
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,220
how can I utilize catalog sources in creative ways?

214
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,340
Some of you may be familiar with its usage

215
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,580
as a supplier integration mechanism,

216
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,900
but there's a lot of different ways.

217
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,220
So again, this is to show you the basics

218
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220
so that you can kind of go,

219
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,980
hey, I've learned a bit about it.

220
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,340
Do you think we could do this?

221
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,660
And then you have a conversation with your CSM

222
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,460
and we can see what we can achieve.

223
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,980
So as you log into EDP,

224
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,940
you're always welcome to the sales order screen

225
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,620
where you see your lovely sales.

226
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,660
To navigate to the catalog source screen,

227
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,060
you go to the catalog module

228
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,180
and then you go to catalog sources.

229
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,620
First thing you're gonna notice

230
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,260
is that they are channel specific.

231
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,100
When you're utilizing a catalog source,

232
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:52,110
you're updating the data on a specific channel.

233
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,510
You can create a new catalog source up here.

234
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,710
You can create them from marketplaces

235
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,870
or for your ETail channel

236
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,390
or for your various supplier channels.

237
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:06,960
So in this case, I'm gonna create a new one.

238
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,480
Just gonna get rid of our test one.

239
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,360
I'm gonna do new catalog source

240
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,010
and I'm gonna select from a file.

241
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,650
You're gonna see this window here.

242
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,830
You're gonna hit the spy glass

243
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,710
that's gonna allow you to find that external data.

244
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,390
I like to use the metaphor of this external data

245
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,230
as a truckload of information

246
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,470
and I don't wanna just throw it from my truck

247
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,470
into my warehouse.

248
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,630
I wanna bring it onto a loading dock,

249
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,270
organize it, understand it

250
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,510
and then move it into my warehouse.

251
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,550
So my warehouse stays nice and organized.

252
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,470
Again, your EDP catalog,

253
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,990
you want as pristine as possible

254
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,310
because in the e-commerce world, content is king.

255
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,590
And so if your content isn't up to par

256
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,470
being kept updated,

257
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,110
as you all know, you have struggles.

258
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,260
So I select the file

259
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,180
and I'm gonna get a preview here.

260
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,460
I'm gonna hit this configure button

261
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,040
and here you have various options.

262
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,760
The main ones you'll probably utilize

263
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,920
are telling it how that file is delimited.

264
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,580
As you can see here, we have a number of options.

265
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,460
You're also going to typically indicate

266
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,140
that your file has column headers.

267
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,260
So I can see here,

268
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,260
I have a column header for these various fields

269
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,420
but it's not the first row.

270
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,840
So I'm going to skip the first row

271
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,740
and say the first row I don't skip has headers.

272
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,160
I hit okay, you'll see this preview.

273
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,140
Again, this is a preview of the catalog source

274
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,780
showing you what the headers are

275
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,420
and everything looks parsed correctly.

276
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,340
So I'm gonna hit save.

277
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,260
By default catalog source will be named

278
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,580
the same as the file you used to create it.

279
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,540
Once you've created the initial catalog source,

280
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,980
you'll be welcomed by this screen

281
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,380
showing you that it's loading the data.

282
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,420
Again, at this point, we're putting the data,

283
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,420
we're taking the data off of that truck

284
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,220
and putting it onto a loading dock so we can organize it.

285
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,620
Once the data is loaded,

286
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,160
you come to this screen and you hit refresh tab

287
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,500
and you'll see the data.

288
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,580
There's a rule of thumb.

289
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,460
Everything in this yellow is the external data.

290
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,840
It looks like if you did this a few times,

291
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,180
almost everybody could learn how to use this

292
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,360
with just a few practice times.

293
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,480
It's pretty straightforward.

294
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,840
And again, I picked this topic

296
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,380
because the more familiar with the catalog source

297
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,600
and the more comfortable you are using it,

298
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,600
the more empowered you are to A, manage your catalog

299
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,180
and B, diagnose a lot of issues.

300
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,000
I get a lot of people asking,

301
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,700
they submit tickets, hey, inventory didn't update.

302
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,360
It takes you five seconds to check this automation time

303
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,560
and go, oh, we didn't get a file.

304
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,080
I didn't need to reach out or create a support ticket.

305
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,800
I just needed to understand how the catalog source works

306
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,120
and then I can check it myself

307
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,720
and I can go, oh, we didn't get a file.

308
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,080
I need to reach out to the supplier to get file.

309
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,400
They've stopped putting it on the FTP.

310
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,490
Perfect, yeah.

311
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,650
So after you've loaded your data,

312
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,170
you're gonna come to this columns tab

313
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,570
and you establish your mappings.

314
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,150
Again, a mapping is a bridge.

315
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,970
I'm saying, this is my external data.

316
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,450
What does that mean in EVP?

317
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,690
So in this case, I know that the skew is the skew.

318
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,170
And for example, we're just gonna load quantity.

319
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,080
So I know that the supplier stock is the quantity.

320
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,960
But again, you have all these options.

321
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,640
I would learn and get familiar

322
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,960
with all of the mapping options you have available

323
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,880
because again, these are the bridges I can build

324
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,320
between external data and what it means in EVP.

325
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,320
You have a lot of options in various areas.

326
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
Getting familiar with these mapping options

327
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,400
will be very helpful for you and your team.

328
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,240
Once you've set up your mappings,

329
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,800
you're gonna save and close and reopen the catalog source.

330
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,570
Now on the mappings tab, you will see your mappings.

331
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,270
One mapping I wanna call out,

332
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,890
you can change the map type to a custom script.

333
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,650
A custom script allows us to achieve a lot of complexity

334
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,170
when we're handling data, some example usages.

335
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,370
The supplier doesn't provide a very good title.

336
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,130
So I wanna combine multiple fields to make a title.

337
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,810
The supplier provides their wholesale costs,

338
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,130
but I get a discounted rate.

339
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,490
So I need to take a percentage off of the value in the file.

340
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,050
Those are just two examples.

341
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,490
But again, the custom script allows you to achieve

342
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,210
a lot of complexity within the catalog source

343
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,250
when dealing with the data.

344
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,370
So never shy away from asking the question to your CSM.

345
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,730
Hey, do you think we can do this?

346
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,130
Because the answer is probably we can work

347
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,290
with the development team to build a custom script

348
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,290
that does do that.

349
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,450
So it doesn't just have to be your dealing with raw data.

350
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:06,000
You can manipulate it as you're importing it.

351
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,040
Remember, you can ask questions at any time.

352
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,480
Our other CSMs, Jason and James,

353
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,680
or excuse me, Jeff Baker are reviewing those

354
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,640
and trying to get the right ones to me at the right time.

355
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,760
One nuance with quantity loading

356
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,560
is you do have to define a location.

357
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
So that's what I'm doing here.

358
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm spelling at what location that quantity goes to.

359
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,240
So once you've set up your mappings,

360
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,980
you're gonna do actions, analyze data.

361
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,040
This is just gonna scan the data at a very high level.

362
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,200
There is an analysis mapping option

363
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,040
which can do various checks, such as,

364
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,360
and often if the UPC starts with five zeros,

365
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,400
I don't wanna import it.

366
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,820
That's part of the analysis check.

367
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,700
I'm also gonna be told the max length

368
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,180
of the values in that field.

369
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,860
So if one of these says my title is 10,000 characters long,

370
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,580
I know there's probably some issue with my data.

371
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,900
And that's good, I've checked it.

372
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,740
I've identified an issue before I've imported it.

373
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,500
Again, within the catalog source, you're in a loading dock.

374
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,980
So you're not corrupting your EVP catalog at this point.

375
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,640
You're identifying the flaws in your data ahead of time.

376
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,240
So we're just gonna let this analyze

377
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,080
a little bit, a few more seconds.

378
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,360
Well, you're letting it analyze, James.

379
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,320
How do you form...

380
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,640
How do formatting map errors alert you?

381
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,780
And will this cause all data to not load

382
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:55,820
or only the specific fields that were incorrect?

383
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,360
Well, I think you're asking is if the analysis check

384
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,040
determines something's invalid, does it get imported?

385
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,320
Okay.

386
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,040
And the answer would be no.

387
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,880
Okay.

388
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,040
So for example, it happens a lot with UPC,

389
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,680
the system detects that a UPC in the external data

390
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,160
is invalid, that is identified during the analysis check

391
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,500
and it doesn't let you import that invalid UPC.

392
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,560
If you don't have a mapping for a field,

393
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,080
there's no bridge, so the data is left alone.

394
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,000
It's not imported.

395
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,960
So in this case, I'm ignoring all this data

396
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,800
and I'm just importing the quantity by matching on this view.

397
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,680
Got it.

398
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,400
And remember, if we don't get to your question right away,

399
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,760
we're gonna be covering as many as we can

400
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,720
during the question and answer session.

401
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,520
And at the end of James,

402
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,550
just kind of running through this right now.

403
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,950
One thing I like to emphasize

404
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,790
when training people on the catalog source

405
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,350
is you have four options for creating a link.

406
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,630
Well, you technically have five options.

407
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,150
Creating a link from the external data to a SKU

408
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,630
or a master SKU and EVP,

409
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,430
because that's the real first step

410
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:17,030
is telling the system what SKU and the EVP

411
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,890
I need to be updating.

412
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,670
And so your options are SKU,

413
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,230
you can match on the channel SKU,

414
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,670
you can match on the master SKU,

415
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,430
you can match on a UPC, a part number,

416
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,720
or an attribute.

417
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,520
If you wanna match on those beyond master SKU and SKU,

418
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,320
you would configure that here.

419
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,760
And again, that allows you to build that bridge

420
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,600
between the external data and what it is in EVP.

421
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,880
So on step three,

422
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,960
we're actually gonna try and apply the maps

423
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,360
that we've set up and build that bridge.

424
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,600
What I also like to emphasize is these first three steps,

425
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,720
you're relatively safe.

426
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,280
You're not gonna corrupt your EVP catalog

427
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,080
by doing these first three steps.

428
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,080
They are contained within that loading stage.

429
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,480
So when apply maps,

430
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,280
you can see here the results of that.

431
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,600
I'm matching on SKU, which is good.

432
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,240
Again, yellow is external data.

433
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,600
Green is telling me,

434
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,720
the green section is telling me,

435
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,400
okay, this is the channel SKU.

436
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,960
And again, I'm on a specific channel.

437
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,480
And then this is the master SKU

438
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,880
and these look could be correct.

439
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,380
There's no numbers line up.

440
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,660
So this is where you can check your results

441
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,620
before you import,

442
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,220
which is really powerful because again,

443
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,860
it lets you find flaws in your data.

444
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,700
It lets you see,

445
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,140
hey, I'm not matching on a bunch of stuff.

446
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,500
Does that mean the data is wrong?

447
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,700
Or do I have potential SKUs I can create?

448
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,900
Yeah, the last thing you wanna do

449
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,740
is corrupt your catalog in EVP.

450
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,260
Typically you have to reach out to your CSM

451
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,220
and have them help you fix it,

452
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,460
which is distracting from growth driving business.

453
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,900
So once you've applied the maps,

454
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,340
you'll see the matches,

455
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,380
you'll see where it didn't match.

456
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,740
This screen here is exportable

457
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,700
and can be exported into Excel.

458
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,980
So you can kind of filter out,

459
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,900
identify stuff that didn't match,

460
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,180
do various layers of manipulation if needed.

461
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,580
After it's applied the maps,

462
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,280
you would do action step four,

463
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,960
which would load the data

464
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,240
to the record it's built a bridge to.

465
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,640
If I, I'm gonna let this run,

466
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,320
let's go take a second.

467
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,280
I'm gonna cover the settings really quick.

468
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,120
Again, I talked about the matching.

469
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,440
This allows us to match to data points

470
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,880
beyond SKU and master SKU.

471
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,160
The other section you're gonna be wanna,

472
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,720
going to want to be familiar with

473
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,920
is the create and update.

474
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,520
I cover this a bit more in depth

475
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,400
on the documentation that we will provide,

476
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,400
but essentially think of catalog items as master SKUs.

477
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,060
Do I wanna create or update master SKUs?

478
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,080
You should be familiar with master SKU level details

479
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,080
like a master, a title, UPC, UOM information.

480
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,400
Those are all stored at the master SKU level.

481
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,560
Then do I wanna create or update channel records?

482
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,560
This is typically attributes, images, stuff like that.

483
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,930
A channel record can be a supplier record

484
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,850
or a marketplace record.

485
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,330
But again, if I need to create a channel record,

486
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,770
I have to have a master SKU.

487
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,450
So, but this will control how we update

488
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:42,500
or create master SKUs and SKUs.

489
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,300
So as I applied map, we're almost done there.

490
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,420
You would do action step four and load the data,

491
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,500
which we may or may not get to.

492
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,940
But that's the very basics.

493
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,580
You're getting your external data,

494
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,580
you're importing it to a catalog source,

495
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,460
you're establishing your mappings,

496
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,900
you're applying your mappings and analyzing the results

497
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,700
and then you're importing the data.

498
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,260
And again, the power behind the catalog source

499
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,900
is once you've set it up, you can automate it.

500
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,540
So if that file is regularly available,

501
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,060
you can set up automation so we pull that file.

502
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,460
You also have the ability to check the data

503
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
before you import it,

504
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,340
which when setting up a new catalog for a new supplier is huge.

505
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,180
And again-

506
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,700
So James, just let me reiterate,

507
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,820
in these 10, 12 minutes, we've taken an external file,

508
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,620
brought it in DVP, corrected it,

509
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,340
analyzed it, created our mappings

510
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,020
and imported 21,000 new items into our catalog

511
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,060
that once you have the quantity or the,

512
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,300
you said what you wanna do in the pricing,

513
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,380
you got 20,000 new products up on your sales channels,

514
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,140
ready to go.

515
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,460
Yeah, I mean, if we were creating supplier records here,

516
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,420
you'd get your item creators to run

517
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:09,420
and yeah, you could add 21,000 new listings for each channel.

518
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,260
Fantastic.

519
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,540
And again, I emphasize that getting familiar

520
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,860
with the catalog source,

521
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,500
A, allows you to set up flat file suppliers on your own

522
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,420
and B, diagnose what's going on

523
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,820
with the automation that's been set up.

524
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,540
Okay, another quick question for you.

525
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,020
How does it work when a supplier's inventory record

526
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,620
drops from their feed?

527
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,340
Will it expire the inventory and set it to zero?

528
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,220
So if somebody had a hundred items in their normal feed

529
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,020
and now there's only 99.

530
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,140
Yeah, you can configure the system to behave in various ways

531
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,100
when that occurs.

532
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,260
So in the availability section you've seen here,

533
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,500
if I check expire and after days,

534
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,340
if the specific SKU has not had quantity loaded

535
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,980
from this file in three days,

536
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,300
we will expire the inventory.

537
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,340
So if you'll want to expire right away,

538
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,140
I would check the box and leave it at zero.

539
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,460
You can also define behavior for if no file is found.

540
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,420
So the supplier stops dropping off a file,

541
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,700
we can expire everything

542
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,820
if we don't find a file after X amount of days.

543
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,260
So you do have options to expire availability

544
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,500
if the row is dropped from the file.

545
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,420
So it sounds like we thought of everything.

546
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,260
If you can think of the example,

547
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,420
we're gonna cover it somehow.

548
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,540
Okay.

549
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,380
Yeah.

550
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,420
James, why don't you throw it back over to me?

551
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:54,740
Sounds good.

552
00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:00,040
Okay, this is the one thing we have to figure out

553
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,600
as we do these monthly

554
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,120
to be a little bit more efficient

555
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,960
in the passing of the baton, but we'll get better.

556
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,440
We also would be on saying what we should do

557
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,080
in these webinars,

558
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,320
give us suggestions on how we can get better.

559
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,440
This is our first one.

560
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,360
I know I'm just killing it,

561
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,080
and I'm kind of dragging James along,

562
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,800
but what can we do to make this more interesting,

563
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,640
more pertinent, or just more enjoyable?

564
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,480
I can tell jokes.

565
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,520
Some of the uses, we did the demo,

566
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,360
some of the real uses,

567
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,120
let's think about how to use it.

568
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,920
We've given you literally how easy it is to use.

569
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,760
I don't think any of you that were at novices

570
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,320
coming in today would consider yourself experts,

571
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,120
but you now understand what the power is.

572
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,600
One of our future sessions may give you

573
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,320
additional tools and techniques on how to use this,

574
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,680
but now you know what it's for

575
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,520
and how you can use it for your business.

576
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,880
You can import content, images

577
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,760
to improve the quality of your listings.

578
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,720
You can set up those supplier integrations

579
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,440
for inventory level information.

580
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,760
Nobody likes to have their ODR go down

581
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,760
because they ran out of inventory

582
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,440
in their dropship suppliers,

583
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,200
and you want to be able to sell at a price

584
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,480
that's a good price for you.

585
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,480
Win the buy box, but make some profit, make some margin.

586
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,880
James, you can probably address the last bullet point

587
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,360
a little bit better than I can.

588
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,640
Yeah, so again, content, supplier integrations

589
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,200
are the primary ways in which catalog sources are used,

590
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,230
and another way they can be used

591
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,510
is with the active inventory option.

592
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,630
So on marketplaces, instead of using an external file,

593
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,790
I can build a file based on the active inventory

594
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,830
on that marketplace.

595
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,350
So what you would see in the new catalog source dropdown

596
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,550
on a channel like Amazon is an option

597
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,630
to choose active inventory.

598
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,390
That uses the API connection to build a file

599
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,830
of everything that's existing out on the marketplace

600
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,030
that's active at that point in time,

601
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:31,030
and allows you to do a comparison of what's going on in EVP.

602
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,030
Historically, people would have to export something

603
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,470
from EVP, export something from the marketplace,

604
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,870
put Excel files right next to each other.

605
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,190
With the active inventory catalog source,

606
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,550
you can do that comparison within the application,

607
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,670
and then take action without having to go from a file

608
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,430
to Excel to a file to an application.

609
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,190
You can do all that assessment in comparison with an EVP.

610
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,430
I've seen a lot of creative usages with that.

611
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:02,430
One example is you can diagnose and make sure

612
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,790
that shipping templates are in sync,

613
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:10,790
and identify items that are potentially having issues

614
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:16,280
that are making them inactive.

615
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,280
Okay, and we're getting towards the end of our time

616
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,320
with you as much as we're enjoying it.

617
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,080
We're in that question and answer session,

618
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,560
and I'm not gonna use any names here,

619
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,560
but can you use the catalog source to create variant groups

620
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,760
and assign your various items to the variant group?

621
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,320
Great question.

622
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,560
It is a good question.

623
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,140
I've worked, the SME of variations on our team is Heather.

624
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,380
I do believe that the catalog source can be utilized

625
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,420
to set up variations in child-parent relationships.

626
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,940
Okay, obviously for more information, contact your CSM,

627
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,940
and if we need to have Heather jump on the call

628
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,820
or answer a few more questions, we'll figure that out.

629
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,660
Here's another one we have.

630
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,660
Can the catalog source be used to automate marketing data

631
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,220
that is sitting on a supplier FTP site?

632
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,900
For example, supplier gives us marketing data weekly.

633
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,820
Can we automatically grab the new file and load it in the VP?

634
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,020
I mean, usually when we talk about automate,

635
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,220
we're talking hourly, daily.

636
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
What about setting them up a week apart?

637
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,860
Yeah, the schedules can be set to any sort of cadence.

638
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,900
Yes, you could import marketing data

639
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,140
from suppliers on a weekly basis.

640
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,100
You would also wanna look at and work with your CSM

641
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,140
on utilizing the attribute mappings

642
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,500
so that that data as it's updated on the supplier record

643
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,100
gets pushed up to the marketplace to supplier lists

644
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,060
or sales listings.

645
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,980
But you could definitely pull a file from an FTP

646
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,100
or have them drop it off on ours, import it weekly,

647
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,060
and that updates attribute level marketing details.

648
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,660
And then if you have attribute maps,

649
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,860
which essentially take an attribute from one channel

650
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,700
and populate it on another,

651
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,540
that would automatically be updated and republished

652
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,860
as that content is imported.

653
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,820
Okay, here's gonna be a really good one.

654
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,660
How do you pull current catalog sources

655
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,180
and their mapping already in EVP

656
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:48,540
so that you can use this as a template?

657
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,540
So I think I'm gonna answer this question correctly.

658
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,580
If I set up a catalog source

659
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,260
and I have a bunch of intricate mappings

660
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,180
with custom scripts and whatnot,

661
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,140
and I wanna reuse those mappings

662
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,220
and a different catalog source,

663
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,740
you can export mappings

664
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,220
and re-import them on other catalog sources.

665
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,940
So the mappings can be exported into a map file

666
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,420
and then re-import it on a different catalog source.

667
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,260
Perfect.

668
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,260
And will the catalog source replace the MCIs in the future?

669
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:29,620
Is it possible to add MCIs functionality

670
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:35,710
into the catalog source?

671
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,110
By the way, James,

672
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,350
I don't know, it's an appropriate question for some of these.

673
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,790
What I would wanna know is the things you're doing

674
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:47,710
with the MCI that you can't do with the catalog source

675
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,110
because I haven't run into that scenario very often.

676
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,750
You can pretty much,

677
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,030
we would like to see you use the catalog source

678
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,870
more and more again,

679
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,550
because it has that checks and balances.

680
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,750
The MCI has its purpose in its place,

681
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,390
but I always try and use the catalog source first.

682
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,750
So I'd want more details

683
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,550
on what you aren't able to achieve

684
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,630
with the catalog source that you are with the MCI.

685
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:16,790
So a great example of reach out directly to your CSM,

686
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,830
have that very thorough discussion

687
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,590
about what you're trying to do,

688
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,110
how you're using the MCIs,

689
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,110
and how we would do that same,

690
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:29,710
those same set of functions in the catalog source,

691
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,990
or what do you believe might be missing?

692
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,630
But a very good question.

693
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,470
I would just end with, on that note,

694
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,200
I'll move on to the next question.

695
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,040
Okay.

696
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,000
Do you know when some listings fail to be created?

697
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,120
We always have to fix the column,

698
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,560
mostly authorized or manufacturing alignment issues

699
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,640
when we manually create the listings,

700
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,440
but ETL doesn't really show us such details.

701
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,440
I guess that question is already being answered.

702
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,840
So look forward in your chat box,

703
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,960
because one of our CSMs has jumped onto that one.

704
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,600
What if there are a bunch of product categories

705
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,240
or a certain manufacturer, I don't want to load.

706
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,760
Can I block the manufacturer or category from loading?

707
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,480
Yeah, absolutely.

708
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Again, the analysis mapping allows you to set up

709
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,120
various if-then statements.

710
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,320
So if I meet this condition, then I don't import.

711
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,040
You can look for strings of text.

712
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,840
You can look at the starting string and say,

713
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,560
hey, if it starts with this,

714
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,560
you can look within the whole field and find a string.

715
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,400
So there's a lot of options to exclude data

716
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,840
as it's getting imported,

717
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,000
and only importing the data that you want

718
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,920
from the external file.

719
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,760
Perfect.

720
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,200
I think-

721
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,560
Oh, I remember what I was gonna say.

722
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,400
If you left with processes that utilize the MCI

723
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,360
from historical processes that you just left with,

724
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,080
I would revisit those with your CSM

725
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,930
to evaluate whether it makes sense to transition them.

726
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,970
Okay.

727
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:29,290
And one last question before we move on.

728
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:34,290
Can the catalog import match with bulk image uploads

729
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:43,780
if naming title schemes are followed?

730
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,340
Not sure I follow the question.

731
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,660
I think what they're asking is,

732
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:52,780
can I bulk import images

733
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,780
if the title of the image is the same?

734
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,630
I'm gonna ask you to follow up with your CSM on that one,

735
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,270
but thank you for the question.

736
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,990
What I would say is you can configure the catalog source

737
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,110
to either update or add images.

738
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,550
So you can replace images

739
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,190
or you can add it as a secondary image.

740
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,110
Okay.

741
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:24,110
So next month, second Wednesday,

742
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,030
1 p.m. Eastern time,

743
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,870
you figure out the time adjustment for your time zone.

744
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,910
You'll be getting an email.

745
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:36,150
You're gonna get invited again and please register.

746
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,390
Even I know that sometimes the reminders

747
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,350
or the final link can end up in your spam folder.

748
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,150
So if you don't see the info,

749
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,670
please look in that spam folder.

750
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:55,670
And while we have a series of these webinars planned out,

751
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,350
we want you to direct us to where we go.

752
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,830
If in your survey or through your conversations

753
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,990
in your meetings with their CSM,

754
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,270
we see other topics that are of higher value

755
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,630
to a greater number of people,

756
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,830
we will be more than happy to provide webinars on that.

757
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,910
I want you to remember to fill,

758
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,150
please fill out your survey at the end of the session.

759
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,990
If you don't fill it online, you're gonna get an email.

760
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,830
Also, before the beginning of every next webinar,

761
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,430
we're gonna actually take a poll

762
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:39,310
to judge the expertise level of the people attending

763
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:44,310
and we can dial in how we present the information.

764
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,870
We do wanna thank you

765
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:50,430
for attending the first of TechEdges.

766
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,590
We do wanna make a difference in your business.

767
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:57,550
We do wanna become your most valuable tool

768
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,150
in your organization.

769
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,270
And we will do anything and everything,

770
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,190
well, almost everything we can do to make that happen.

771
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,710
All your CSMs are around this afternoon.

772
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,470
If you wanna fire them an email,

773
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,590
we can cover this in your weeklies or monthlies.

774
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,750
But thank you for attending.

775
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:18,870
Please fill out the survey.

776
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,710
And James, do you have any parting wise words

777
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:27,860
for the people that attended today?

778
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,740
Okay, no wise words.

779
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,340
Learn about the mapping options on catalog sources

780
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,700
and I look forward to seeing you guys next time.

781
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,620
Perfect.

782
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,700
So a tool that's there,

783
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,740
that is, I think everybody will recognize

784
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:45,900
is much easier to use than anybody thought

785
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,700
that can improve your business,

786
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,340
increase your catalog size

787
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,500
and allow you to find ways to grow your business.

788
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,700
Major wins in all ways.

789
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,900
And with that, James and I are gonna sign off.

790
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,980
Until next time, adios.
