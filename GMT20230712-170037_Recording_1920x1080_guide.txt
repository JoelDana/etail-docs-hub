## Quick Steps

1. Okay.
2. Yes.
3. Yes.
4. Excellent.
5. Center. Most of them have some significant documentation, and I will say that we know that.
6. It does give you a sense of the impact when this is set up, set up correctly,.
7. And continuously run. Always looking for new ways or nuances to put your settings at,.
8. Then we're going to explore the matching criteria options you have, which are the filters available.
9. These articles are available on the Help Center. When you guys access the Help Center,.
10. For the dynamic auto-matcher. I encourage you to open that up and review that as we go through.
11. Best practices. One thing you'll learn with the dam is it is a sort of set it and forget it,.
12. Again, Jeff and me are doing this webinar. I should update my picture. As you can see,.
13. Criteria, which essentially says it filters out ASINs that don't match a certain tier of quality,.
14. You can implement it in steps so that some listings go to a fully automated publishing and some go to.
15. You have tiered matching. You can optimize the match process for various types of listing quality.
16. Automature with your CSM is what options do I have to filter listings? By filter listings,.
17. Package quantities, this can help with UOM variations. When someone creates an ASIN,.
18. Pack quantities that we know we can fulfill. I will comment that not everyone who sets up an.
19. ASIN knows exactly what this field means, and so sometimes it is set up incorrectly on the ASIN,.
20. Next set of matching criteria. When you're matching with the Dynamic Automatture, you have two.
21. Manufacturing EVP and make sure those align. Now, as many of you know, people set up manufacturers.
22. With tons of name variations. EVP handles that through the manufacturer name mapping tool.
23. And the Dynamic Automatture will utilize that if the Muse manufacturer mapping is set to true,.
24. Discuss that with your CSM. It's always good to check. You go to Amazon channel.
25. And then up in the top banner there's a list of manufacturers. You click on that list button.
26. So you can engage with the CSM, configure them, set them up, and have them running on an automation.
27. Processor settings control. Do we check for stock before we even consider scanning the item?
28. It's going to run multiple times a day. If you have it set up where you're running it on an.
29. So you don't get throttled. And then lastly, processor settings control match limits. So.
30. Confirmed matches, the dam will stop. And then I would have to either let the automation kick.
31. In line. If I remove a lot of these options or set them to false, I consider my match rule.
32. Is going to be the publication mode, the availability mode? Am I going to set a max stock? Will the.
33. State is inverse in that if I want to edit the review state of a dynamic automature,.
34. I edit the left side. I would change this to verified or confirmed.
35. Whereas all the other settings, you're changing the right side.
36. The last thing to mention about match groups that's very important is it.
37. Calls this dynamic automature if it should use an item set.
38. To segment your catalog with item sets. A lot of people do it by brand or manufacturer.
39. The reason this is important is you're going to find trends.
40. Not great, and I'll have to review those listings. But again, item sets are controlled.
41. By the match group. Talked about item sets a lot in the webinars because they're very powerful,.
42. Matches, opens up the listing from the button here, checks that it's the right product,.
43. It's good to sell, and then manually updates the item from an unverified status to a.
44. Using a dam that has less matching criteria. Rejected is important to use. A bad habit is,.
45. Hey, that's a bad match, I delete it from EVP. What that's going to do is we're just going to.
46. Don't delete it. Set the item, set the Amazon listing to reject it. This tells EVP that that.
47. Listing, so those kind of get filtered out. But again, it's important to set bad matches to.
48. Reject it and not delete them, so we keep track of them in EVP and don't try and rematch.
49. To publish. You need to go in and manually review it. Confirm is a very powerful option.
50. Review every single match. What a confirmed status listing will do will make the match,.
51. Hold, and it prompts the user to check the item, put it on, update the review status,.
52. I can deal with canceling one order and then setting it to rejected. So I make a bunch of.
53. Matches, I put them in confirmed status, and as I'm getting orders, as I'm selling that product,.
54. Have found this more efficient when dealing with large sets of matches in that.
55. Manually updated it or you have a very strict level of matching criteria. Yeah, because if it's.
56. A step back. I'm not going to match on manufacturer, and I'm going to put those listings in confirmed.
57. And again, ASINs are getting created every day, so running the dam all the time is good,.
58. Do I need to set up a new match?
59. If you're using an item set, which I recommend, you would need to update it to include the new.
60. Specific to that. What I would do is I would, what I do for my clients is I set up a dynamic.
61. Automatcher that's strict, I set up one that's loose, and then a variation of each for UPC and NPM.
62. I would have them create an item set for that supplier, and then I would have them run the.
63. Very strict, I would change the item set and the pre-configured dam and have them run it.
64. Now, if you weren't using item sets, the system will automatically check items.
65. So if you add a supplier and your dam is set up in a more automated way, you don't have to do anything.
66. At a minimum, you may have to create an item set and update that field and then run the dams.
67. 20, 30 new products a year and new SKUs. Do those just fit into those item sets and.
68. Automatically get run? The item set is simply checking the supplier location for inventory.
69. Again, because people typically talk to their CSM about it, set it up, and then forget about it.
70. The way you access those messages is you go into the task and you can export them as a CSV file.
71. Let's curate and focus on the things that create revenue and that create repetitive revenue.
72. How would I set up my dam if I have multiple Amazon storefronts and I want to be category specific?
73. Setting up almost two separate businesses, two separate websites, two separate Amazon accounts,.
74. Item set for each one of those particular businesses, correct?
75. And you would set up the item sets to handle that.
76. Item sets, again, I'm going to nail hit that nail many times.
77. Item sets can segment your catalog. Segmenting your catalog allows more granular considerations.
78. Dynamic auto matcher versus just having it all go to unverify. I see a lot of people do that.
79. And then again, periodic review, ASINs are getting created all the time, trends are changing,.
80. So setting it, forgetting it for a period of time is okay,.
81. Is how many of you set up dam during your initial implementation,.
82. Is it time to relook at some of your settings and re-running it?
83. Yeah, and lastly, a simple setup for the dam, in the additional documentation,.
84. If you want a very simple setup, we would add those four steps,.
