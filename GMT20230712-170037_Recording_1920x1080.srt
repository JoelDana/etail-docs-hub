00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
Welcome back to Tech Edge number five, as today we're going to discuss dynamic auto-matching,

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,680
or as we know it, what the damn are you doing with our listings. To those on the east coast,

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,920
good afternoon. To those on the west coast, good morning. Thank you for joining us and a belated

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:32,960
happy 4th of July. We're glad you're here. I do want to remind you that these are all in the help

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:41,280
center. Most of them have some significant documentation, and I will say that we know that

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:50,000
our initial pricing webinar is still the most watched. Let's see if we can edge that out of

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,680
first place with dynamic auto-matching. Just as an example of the potential of dynamic auto-matching

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:11,280
is one of our larger clients can directly draw a straight line to over 30% or approximately 30%

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:20,080
of their sales coming from dynamic auto-matching. This is a seller that does over $50 million a year.

10
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:32,080
I don't know. I consider $15 million real money. While not everyone will have the exact same results,

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,680
it does give you a sense of the impact when this is set up, set up correctly,

12
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:48,640
and continuously run. Always looking for new ways or nuances to put your settings at,

13
00:01:48,640 --> 00:02:00,400
to always look for new listings. More listings per SKU results in greater revenue.

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:11,280
James, take it away. The agenda for today, you've met me and Jeff several times so we can

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,920
gloss over the introduction. We are hoping to have some new faces on the upcoming webinars,

16
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,400
but I will keep at it, keep educating, and helping enable you to grow your business.

17
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,080
We're going to briefly talk about what the dynamic auto-matcher is and what it does for you.

18
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,640
Then we're going to explore the matching criteria options you have, which are the filters available

19
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,440
for checking the quality of an ASIN. Go through the basics of configuring the job which is controlled

20
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:50,640
by XML. Discuss the review state and how that impacts matches. What you can do to assess the

21
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,920
dynamic auto-matching results and how to leverage that to refine and optimize. What you can do to

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,850
maximize your damn potential, and then we'll have some space for Q&A. As Jeff mentioned,

23
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:12,690
these articles are available on the Help Center. When you guys access the Help Center,

24
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:19,250
you typically see something like this suggesting a ticket. This link up here gets you to the

25
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,090
archive of webinars, and you can see there is already some introductory material

26
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,290
for the dynamic auto-matcher. I encourage you to open that up and review that as we go through

27
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,730
the various slides, as that will help give additional context to what I'm discussing today.

28
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,530
Then the recording will be put here. Go ahead, Jeff.

29
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,930
I think the best practices is probably the best document to look at first,

30
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:58,370
understanding not only what the different criteria are, but what we found over the last

31
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:04,850
almost 13 and a half years in working with all our clients, what's worked the best.

32
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,970
This is going to outline the match criteria, which we'll discuss, and then our recommended

33
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,450
best practices. One thing you'll learn with the dam is it is a sort of set it and forget it,

34
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,250
but then you need to periodically check in so you can refine it over time.

35
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,890
The best practices are going to get you the low-hanging fruits, but then

36
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,930
as there's a diminishing return on the dam, you may need to loosen up your restrictions

37
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,810
and have a review process in place, and we'll get into that shortly.

38
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,490
Again, Jeff and me are doing this webinar. I should update my picture. As you can see,

39
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,330
I no longer have there. I'm the one with the really good flow going on.

40
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:02,370
I'll unlock the card again, like Jeff. Again, our mission is to help you drive revenue and

41
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,930
profit to the platform. Again, the goal of the dam is to maximize your listing ratio on Amazon,

42
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,450
which is often the breadwinner channel for a lot of businesses, but can also just grow

43
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:22,530
the channel in general. The dynamic auto-match for Amazon is a tool in EVP to automatically

44
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:29,650
identify and publish to ASINs on Amazon. It helps increase your listing ratio and ultimately

45
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,130
maximizes your sales opportunity by having you present. The more ASINs you're on,

46
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,690
the more opportunity you have to sell that SKU. It allows you to have pre-configured match

47
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:47,890
criteria, which essentially says it filters out ASINs that don't match a certain tier of quality,

48
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,770
and this prevents bad matches, which ultimately prevents canceled orders.

49
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:04,380
The number of people that have put their business at risk because they've used just a UPC match

50
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:16,300
are too numerous to talk about. You need to be careful to self-inflected wounds are the worst kind.

51
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:27,660
Again, this tool, A, it eliminates the labor cost of having a manual user go through and

52
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,420
look for ASINs, which is what some people did historically. They offshored that, and then also

53
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,620
it provides you a lot of guardrails that you don't have if you're just, again, scanning UPC or part

54
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,780
number, which is what a lot of the other tools will do. This has a lot of guardrails and a lot of

55
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:56,590
you can implement it in steps so that some listings go to a fully automated publishing and some go to

56
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,230
a, hey, I've made a match, but I want someone to check it. That's what I'm talking about here.

57
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:07,630
You have tiered matching. You can optimize the match process for various types of listing quality

58
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:16,640
checks. The very first thing you want to understand when you're discussing the dynamic

59
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,640
automature with your CSM is what options do I have to filter listings? By filter listings,

60
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,320
if an ASIN doesn't have an image, I don't want to match to it. If an ASIN has a price that's

61
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,200
far too high and I want to avoid price gouging, I don't want to match to it. There's various options,

62
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,680
and so knowing what these options are allows you to have a discussion with your CSM, hey,

63
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,160
for this brand, I want these restrictions, and for maybe this manufacturer, I don't.

64
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,480
The first matching criteria is minimum offers. It's a number, and it's going to dictate how many

65
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,440
other sellers need to be on the ASIN for us to consider it valid. What we have found historically

66
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,160
is if there's no other sellers, it's typically a bad ASIN and everyone else has abandoned it.

67
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,360
That said, it can also be an opportunity to sell a loan on an ASIN, so you should view it from both

68
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,720
sides. When you initially run the dam, we typically recommend a minimum of one other seller

69
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,680
on an ASIN, but again, you may run out of matches and look at lowering that to zero and

70
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,480
having them in a manual review process. Have image, pretty self-explanatory, true, false.

71
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:37,440
Does the ASIN have an image? Again, I don't know if you've ever bought off Amazon off an ASIN

72
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:45,520
without an image, but it's probably a very low frequency event and indicates an abandoned

73
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,240
or bad ASIN, so typically, we recommend this to be true. I want to see what I'm buying.

74
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,040
Package quantities, this can help with UOM variations. When someone creates an ASIN,

75
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:05,120
they indicate the package quantities. We then allow the dynamic automatured to accept certain

76
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,840
values for that field, and this can help make sure we only match to each's or we only match to

77
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,160
pack quantities that we know we can fulfill. I will comment that not everyone who sets up an

78
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,840
ASIN knows exactly what this field means, and so sometimes it is set up incorrectly on the ASIN,

79
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,400
which leads to mismatches between EVP, but typically, if you start with package quantity one

80
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,040
is your initial base and expand from there, you can catch those listings through a tiered review

81
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,450
process. Minimum and maximum price formula, these are going to be simple price formulas that take

82
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,890
the item cost and multiply it by a factor. If an ASIN is below or above this threshold,

83
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:58,930
we don't allow the match. The driver behind this is A. If it's above or below those thresholds,

84
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:06,050
it's potentially the wrong product because the item cost should be relative across the fulfillment

85
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:12,130
base. Two, it can help prevent getting stuck on listings where you might get a price gouging

86
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:21,570
violation. I can't sell these wet wipes for a thousand percent margin because Amazon will give

87
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:27,250
me a price gouging violation, so that can help prevent that situation from occurring, too,

88
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,450
but the main driver is if I can expect this item to sell within this range

89
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:38,610
by the ASIN is outside of that range, it's likely the wrong product or a UOM variation of the

90
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:48,400
product. Lastly, on this slide, sales rank below, it's a number of an ASIN has to be above that

91
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,320
threshold to be a valid match. This can prevent matching the ASINs that are below a sales rank

92
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,360
threshold that you deem, you know, I don't want to deal with listings below this threshold.

93
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,800
Next set of matching criteria. When you're matching with the Dynamic Automatture, you have two

94
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:16,800
options. You can use the UPC of the product or you can use part number. A very strict configuration

95
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,400
would have me check the UPC and the part number and the manufacturer, so that's the most restricted

96
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,560
you can really get, and so what this matching criteria does is I'd be matching on part number

97
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,840
or UPC and I'm telling the system I also want to check the manufacturer of the ASIN and the

98
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:42,960
manufacturing EVP and make sure those align. Now, as many of you know, people set up manufacturers

99
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:50,880
with tons of name variations. EVP handles that through the manufacturer name mapping tool

100
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,760
and the Dynamic Automatture will utilize that if the Muse manufacturer mapping is set to true,

101
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:07,280
so we can handle all the name variations on Amazon as long as they've been configured in EVP.

102
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,440
Discuss that with your CSM. It's always good to check. You go to Amazon channel

103
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,880
and then up in the top banner there's a list of manufacturers. You click on that list button

104
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,840
and you can see on the right side of the screen where we've gotten data from Amazon,

105
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,600
but we don't know what it means in EVP. Having that groomed will help you make more matches.

106
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,400
Match on part number can be utilized when I'm searching on UPC, but I also want the part number

107
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:41,840
to match. Again, a very strict configuration. And then lastly, I can make sure the match

108
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:49,120
matches a supplier UOM. If I'm involved in dropshipping or 3PLs, I need to make sure

109
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,960
that I can fulfill the right UOM. So what the system will do is, oh, this is a pack two.

110
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,240
I don't have a fulfillment option for a pack two, so it's a bad match.

111
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:08,530
Those are the main matching criteria you have to leverage. We'll explain how they're configured

112
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:15,490
in the XML, but again, being familiar with what options you have allows you to determine

113
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,450
what level of strictness or looseness you're going to have on your dynamic auto-matching.

114
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:29,780
So the dynamic auto-match your task has steps and the steps are configured with XML. There's

115
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:36,740
three sections of the XML you should be familiar with. Again, the expectation is not that you go

116
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,660
and configure the XML yourself, although you can. But to give you the background knowledge

117
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:50,100
so you can engage with the CSM, configure them, set them up, and have them running on an automation

118
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,460
or run manually as needed. But knowing what these three sections do will give you all the

119
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,340
information you need to kind of have that intelligent conversation with the CSM.

120
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:08,260
Processor settings control. Do we check for stock before we even consider scanning the item?

121
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,420
This is a good thing if you have a large catalog and a lot of it's out of stock all the time.

122
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,460
I don't want to clog up my Amazon account with listing matches that I'm never going to sell

123
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,940
because they're out of stock. So it's good to have a stock check in place, and then you can

124
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,940
have a minimum stock check. So if you wanted to say, oh, I need at least 10 in stock,

125
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,980
you can have that. It controls how many items we look up at a time. So you can see this lookup

126
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:38,820
limit is 8,000. So each time the dam runs, it's going to check 8,000 SKUs. I don't recommend

127
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,220
going above that number. If you're running it multiple times a day, you can get throttled.

128
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,580
But if you're running it as needed, you may be able to push that limit and then match limit.

129
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,700
That's great to know, James, because that is one of the questions that just came in.

130
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:00,980
How many listings can I look up at a time? So you've already answered that one for whoever asked it.

131
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,180
Yeah, if you're running the dam on a schedule in the background, do you want a lower number? Because

132
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,660
it's going to run multiple times a day. If you have it set up where you're running it on an

133
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,220
as-needed basis, you may be able to put this number higher because it's not going to run

134
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,740
repeatedly in the background. But I recommend staying below 10,000 at the time, again,

135
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,620
so you don't get throttled. And then lastly, processor settings control match limits. So

136
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,420
you can see here, we'll go over the review state in a moment. But if I make 1,000

137
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:41,780
confirmed matches, the dam will stop. And then I would have to either let the automation kick

138
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,380
it off or it would run on its own. But this is a way, you can see here, unverified limits, 400.

139
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,260
If I run the dam and I get 400 unverified matches, I'm going to have to go check those.

140
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:58,580
So I want that number to be lower. So the workload's more manageable. But again,

141
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,780
it controls, do we check for stock? How many items do we look up at a time?

142
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:12,670
And what review statuses limits are there? Additionally, you'll see the check days.

143
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,470
What this is doing is saying, hey, I checked this item. I'm going to check it again in two days.

144
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,830
Depending on your catalog size, that number needs to be fluctuated. But engage with your

145
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:29,790
CSM2 is a good default. So we get to your whole catalog. And then we check again in two days.

146
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,840
The next section of the XML is the match rules. The match rules will control the matching

147
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:44,960
criteria we discussed. So I can either add or remove various matching criteria and that will

148
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:52,350
affect my match rule. Again, if I have everything in place, I consider that very strict. It's only

149
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:59,870
going to match to what I would predict as high quality ASINs because the criteria has to be so

150
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:06,110
in line. If I remove a lot of these options or set them to false, I consider my match rule

151
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:13,550
a lot looser. And I'm going to match the things that might be of lower quality or the wrong ASIN.

152
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,830
But once you've got all your strict matches, you do need to kind of loosen up the dam and

153
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,910
find out what else is out there on Amazon. So again, the match rule

154
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:31,470
is a configuration of matching criteria that we discussed on the previous slide.

155
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,980
It's just like the idea that if you're selling a product that could be listed in

156
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,380
two different categories and you're only listed in one,

157
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,740
let's find that other category and get you listed there also.

158
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:59,490
Lastly, you have match group. Match group controls what we do with a match if we find it. So what

159
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:05,890
is going to be the publication mode, the availability mode? Am I going to set a max stock? Will the

160
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:13,570
system use automatic pricing? One thing to note about match group is that the review

161
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:20,930
state is inverse in that if I want to edit the review state of a dynamic automature,

162
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,250
I edit the left side. I would change this to verified or confirmed.

163
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,210
Whereas all the other settings, you're changing the right side.

164
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,120
The last thing to mention about match groups that's very important is it

165
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,720
calls this dynamic automature if it should use an item set.

166
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,280
I'll expand on this idea later on in the PowerPoint, but it's very powerful

167
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,480
to segment your catalog with item sets. A lot of people do it by brand or manufacturer.

168
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,440
The reason this is important is you're going to find trends

169
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,480
on ASIN quality with similar products. In the automotive space, very often

170
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,280
ASIN quality is associated to the brand of the item.

171
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,760
Brand X never has UPC on the ASIN, so I have to use part number even though I have a UPC.

172
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:22,480
Or brand Y always has this certain name variation for the manufacturer. So identifying those trends

173
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:32,000
is easier if you segment your catalog. And again, the most typical segmentation I see

174
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,840
is by brand or manufacturer. Those are where you see trends across ASINs and you can identify,

175
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,160
okay, this brand, I need a really loose dynamic automature because the ASIN quality out there is

176
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,240
not great, and I'll have to review those listings. But again, item sets are controlled

177
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,720
by the match group. Talked about item sets a lot in the webinars because they're very powerful,

178
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:02,800
cool, and again, they help you segment your catalog. I've mentioned this a few times,

179
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:10,880
but we have review status, review state, and EVP. You see this on the listing screen here,

180
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,120
and the dropdown shows you the options. Covering them briefly here, again, they're

181
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,840
covered in more detail in the supplementary documentation. If I make an unverified match,

182
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,280
it has to be manually checked. So I would have a very loose dynamic automature with limited

183
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,760
matching criteria, and then the expectation is a user comes in, looks at all the unverified

184
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,920
matches, opens up the listing from the button here, checks that it's the right product,

185
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,440
it's good to sell, and then manually updates the item from an unverified status to a

186
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,960
verified status. Again, this is the least automated option, but it can be utilized when you're

187
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:02,720
using a dam that has less matching criteria. Rejected is important to use. A bad habit is,

188
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,800
hey, that's a bad match, I delete it from EVP. What that's going to do is we're just going to

189
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,040
rematch to it. So what we've added is the rejected status. If you identified a bad match,

190
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:20,560
don't delete it. Set the item, set the Amazon listing to reject it. This tells EVP that that

191
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:28,060
is a bad ASIN, so we won't try and match to it again, and you have it cataloged as a rejected

192
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:33,340
listing, so those kind of get filtered out. But again, it's important to set bad matches to

193
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,740
reject it and not delete them, so we keep track of them in EVP and don't try and rematch.

194
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,140
And it'll improve your throughput.

195
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,220
Review status is not heavily utilized. It's similar to unverified. Listings aren't going

196
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:55,980
to publish. You need to go in and manually review it. Confirm is a very powerful option

197
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,540
if you want to leverage the dam with looser configuration, but you don't want to

198
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:10,140
review every single match. What a confirmed status listing will do will make the match,

199
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:16,300
publish the listing and the items, but the first time you get an order, it puts that order on

200
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:24,060
hold, and it prompts the user to check the item, put it on, update the review status,

201
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:29,100
and then either fulfill or cancel the order. And the philosophy behind this is, again,

202
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,980
if I'm making a lot of matches and it's too costly to review each one,

203
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:44,860
I can deal with canceling one order and then setting it to rejected. So I make a bunch of

204
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:51,260
matches, I put them in confirmed status, and as I'm getting orders, as I'm selling that product,

205
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,340
I'm slowly grooming those matches to a verified status or a rejected status. And some people

206
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:03,420
have found this more efficient when dealing with large sets of matches in that

207
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,500
it's only ever presented to you once you've sold it, and then you have to deal with it. You're not

208
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:16,140
dealing with matches when they're unsold. And then lastly, you have verified status. This is

209
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:23,980
the most automated status. Listings are live, orders will flow. Use this when you have either

210
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:31,900
manually updated it or you have a very strict level of matching criteria. Yeah, because if it's

211
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:39,980
matched all those variables, it's almost guaranteed to be a good match. I didn't say guaranteed.

212
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:46,460
Yeah. But again, if you're checking UPC and manufacturer and part number, and those all three

213
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:53,420
sync up an image and price and all those other things, that's where you can really leverage

214
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,860
automation and say, hey, just make those matches, make those listings live. Over time,

215
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,260
you'll find a diminishing return because you matched everything. Okay, now I'm going to take

216
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,700
a step back. I'm not going to match on manufacturer, and I'm going to put those listings in confirmed.

217
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,980
Okay, over a period of time, I go back and reassess. All right, now I'm just going to

218
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,540
match on UPC, and I'm going to put those in unverified and have a manually reviewed. So

219
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,140
you start really strict, you loosen up, and then you loosen up even more.

220
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,860
And again, ASINs are getting created every day, so running the dam all the time is good,

221
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,380
but you will find over time, you're matching the less, and that's just because you've

222
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,700
captured most of what's out there. It's always good to have it running.

223
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:44,700
With that in mind, what happens when I add a new supplier? And I have all these dynamic

224
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,100
automatchers running in the background, and I have a bunch of new SKUs on my system.

225
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,980
Do I need to set up a new match?

226
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,140
You would want to be familiar with your dynamic automatcher configuration.

227
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,580
If you're using an item set, which I recommend, you would need to update it to include the new

228
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:12,900
supplier. If it was truly a brand new supplier, I would go through the process of running dams

229
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:19,940
specific to that. What I would do is I would, what I do for my clients is I set up a dynamic

230
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:26,020
automatcher that's strict, I set up one that's loose, and then a variation of each for UPC and NPM.

231
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,860
I would have them create an item set for that supplier, and then I would have them run the

232
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,340
very strict, I would change the item set and the pre-configured dam and have them run it.

233
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,380
Now, if you weren't using item sets, the system will automatically check items

234
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,900
that have inventory exposed, assuming you're doing an inventory check.

235
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:54,340
So if you add a supplier and your dam is set up in a more automated way, you don't have to do anything.

236
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,260
At a minimum, you may have to create an item set and update that field and then run the dams

237
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,420
that are appropriate for the level of matching criteria you want to use.

238
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,380
How about if I add a little tweak to it? Let's say it's a supplier you've done

239
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,340
a lot of business with, but the manufacturers they represent are just adding

240
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:25,300
20, 30 new products a year and new SKUs. Do those just fit into those item sets and

241
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:36,750
automatically get run? The item set is simply checking the supplier location for inventory

242
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:48,270
then yes. That's excellent. One of the most underutilized aspects of the dam,

243
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:54,030
again, because people typically talk to their CSM about it, set it up, and then forget about it.

244
00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:00,590
Again, I encourage quarterly reviews is assessing the dam results. The CSM can assess the dam

245
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:07,070
results, but they don't have the industry knowledge you have to look at. I don't know if

246
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:14,270
part number variations on automotive brand Y are expected or if

247
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,820
a manufacturer name variation is acceptable because sometimes they're very different.

248
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,740
Iron hog and busted wheels are actually the same product. They're just white labeled

249
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,380
and you would know that with industry knowledge and we wouldn't.

250
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Again, when the dam runs, it stores messages which are saying,

251
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,620
hey, I've tried to match this ASIN, but I didn't for one reason or another.

252
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:48,420
What you can do with the results is find the patterns and then adjust your restrictions

253
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,580
and then ultimately adjust your dam configuration and get more matches.

254
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:00,980
The way you access those messages is you go into the task and you can export them as a CSV file.

255
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,340
Then what I do is I go with my clients and I look for a trend. I identify, hey,

256
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,660
we're restricting a lot of potential matches here because we're requiring a manufacturer match.

257
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:16,980
Can we remove that and try? Or, hey, I'm seeing package quantities of 12,

258
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:23,140
24, and 64 and we don't have those configured. Can we add those? That's a judgment call on

259
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:28,820
your end. Can I fulfill those packs? Are those ASINs things I want to be on?

260
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:36,020
Or will they cause me a headache? Again, work with your CSM to get access to the

261
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:45,060
dynamic auto-match or messages to identify trends. It can also be leveraged in that sometimes the

262
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,020
ASIN won't get matched by the dam, but I know it's something I want to sell on,

263
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,940
so I found it in the messages and I just manually add it to the system.

264
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,620
That can be another way the messages are leveraged, but essentially you're looking

265
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:07,230
for trends, adjusting your restrictions, re-running your dam. That pattern identification, that

266
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:12,190
assessment of the messages is not something a lot of people do today and I would encourage

267
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:24,510
you to do more of. James said re-assessing your dam once a quarter is a great best practice.

268
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,390
I know you're all busy. Hopefully the last two days have been

269
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:37,150
really good for you. We're seeing some great numbers on Prime Day from Aladia, so congratulations,

270
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:44,750
but assessing your whole catalog. If you haven't done it in the last year, it's probably

271
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:50,510
something you should do. If you haven't sold something for two years, I understand that

272
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,950
you can make your catalog as massively big as you want, but why?

273
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:05,630
Let's curate and focus on the things that create revenue and that create repetitive revenue.

274
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,840
We're starting to get some questions here, so I'm not going to leave them all to the end.

275
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:20,960
I'm going to pop one at you right now and I'm going to give you the first one right now.

276
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:32,320
How would I set up my dam if I have multiple Amazon storefronts and I want to be category specific?

277
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:43,090
I'm not sure I understand the question. If you had multiple Amazon sales channels,

278
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,970
the Dynamic Automattcher runs on a channel per channel basis.

279
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:54,210
So you would need two, let's get both hands on the screen, two of them,

280
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:58,290
operating under each of your seller names.

281
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:07,650
If you had a unified account, you wouldn't need one for each like Amazon, Canada, and Mexico,

282
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,050
but if you didn't have a unified account or you had two separate Amazon accounts,

283
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,410
you would need separate Dynamic Automattcher tasks.

284
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:23,730
We are seeing more and more of our clients based on category. If they have apparel and automotive,

285
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:31,250
setting up almost two separate businesses, two separate websites, two separate Amazon accounts,

286
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:38,210
those would need the dams themselves may be very, very similar, but they would be an

287
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,690
item set for each one of those particular businesses, correct?

288
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:50,290
Correct. Business X usually fills through supplier X and business Y fills through supplier Y,

289
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,610
and you would set up the item sets to handle that.

290
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,770
We'll get to some of the other ones before the end of the webinar,

291
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,330
but thank you and keep them coming.

292
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:05,250
Questions are great. So maximize your damn potential. Just I love that.

293
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:11,250
Item sets, again, I'm going to nail hit that nail many times.

294
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:18,050
Item sets can segment your catalog. Segmenting your catalog allows more granular considerations

295
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:24,130
if you try and treat. Again, this is going to be specific to your business,

296
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:30,370
but a lot of our clients have a diverse catalog that needs to be segmented so that I can say,

297
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:37,170
hey, brake discs have this level of quality I can expect and swim shorts and curtains

298
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,730
are all going to have different trends in terms of

299
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:48,290
ASIN quality. Again, if you're not sure how to approach segmentation for the dynamic auto

300
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:52,930
matcher, my default and best practice is to look at either manufacturer or brand.

301
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,650
That's where you're going to see the trends.

302
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,900
Look at the degrees of restriction you have and leverage the review status.

303
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,980
Have a dynamic auto matcher that's always running,

304
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,220
that's very restrict and putting items in a verified status.

305
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,780
Have a dynamic auto matcher that's not very restrict and is run as needed,

306
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,780
that puts items in an unverified status that a user then manually reviews.

307
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:29,780
Understand the review states you have and leverage them to run different styles of the

308
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:35,620
dynamic auto matcher versus just having it all go to unverify. I see a lot of people do that.

309
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,780
They run the dam, everything goes down verified and then they manually review it.

310
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:47,620
That defeats the point of some of these features in that you can trust the system with a very strict

311
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,420
matching criteria and make those listings verified.

312
00:33:52,980 --> 00:34:01,700
Procedureized results assessment. Again, I recommend minimum once a quarter biannually

313
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:07,380
looking at the results and looking for trends. If you're adding suppliers every month,

314
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,740
you may want to increase that because identifying those trends,

315
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,900
changing your dam configuration is going to maximize your listing ratio.

316
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:22,020
Work with your CSM to leverage the automation tab. Some of you are unfamiliar or don't have

317
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,700
access to the task screen, which is where you would run the dam.

318
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:30,900
We can enable it so that the dynamic auto matchers can be run from the automation tab,

319
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:35,620
so you may have users where you want them to be in charge of the dam,

320
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:40,020
but you don't want to give them access to tasks. They can access the automation tab

321
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:45,620
and run the dam as needed. Again, this is very powerful for the unverified one.

322
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,580
Hey, I don't want to just build up a list, but today's dam day,

323
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,100
so I'm going to go run the dams and check the listings that have been made.

324
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:01,060
And then again, periodic review, ASINs are getting created all the time, trends are changing,

325
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,420
so setting it, forgetting it for a period of time is okay,

326
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,220
but make sure you have a mindfulness around what was the last time I checked my dams,

327
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:18,180
when was the last time I adjusted those, and make sure it's to some level of frequency.

328
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,700
And I think that's something that we just realized over the last six months or year,

329
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:29,460
is how many of you set up dam during your initial implementation,

330
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:39,700
and maybe shame on us a little bit that we weren't encouraging you or in collaboration with us

331
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:46,980
to review that on a more regular basis, but I think most of you we've had that discussion with us.

332
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,820
Is it time to relook at some of your settings and re-running it?

333
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:01,360
Yeah, and lastly, a simple setup for the dam, in the additional documentation,

334
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,680
I provided four XML templates, strict and loose for UPC and MPM.

335
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,880
If you want a very simple setup, we would add those four steps,

336
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,040
and then you control what listings we look up with item sets,

337
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,640
and all you're doing is going, hey, I want to look at this item set

338
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,920
with very restrict on UPC, or I want to look at this item set very loosely with MPM,

339
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,840
and you're just managing, changing the item set,

340
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,480
so we're looking at different products periodically,

341
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,160
and then you don't have to worry about configuring the dam and adjusting the settings.

342
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,640
You can just leverage what I've kind of built out over time is my default initial pass is

343
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:51,440
restrict, strict and loose on MPM and UPC. Obviously, we can tweak it as much as you need,

344
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,240
but that's a good starting point is looking at those templates I've provided and focusing on

345
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:05,380
building your item sets to be leveraged. So that's all I got. We got more questions, I hope.

346
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,260
Yes, we do. And I think a couple of these

347
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,940
were kind of answered during the webinar, but maybe we didn't get

348
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,540
highlight them enough for going to quite enough depth,

349
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:26,500
but we're going to cover as many as we can, even if we think we've already covered it.

350
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:35,540
If a UPC matched multiple ASINs, different units of measure,

351
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:43,220
will the dam pick up these listings or will it only create one listing

352
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,220
which matches the correct unit of measure?

353
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,880
So again, it would depend on some of the configuration points,

354
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,160
but assuming package quantity allowed that UOM,

355
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,080
and we weren't checking UOM of suppliers, the dynamic auto-match would match to both.

356
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,840
You often see a SKU with a dash and then a number, like a dash two, a dash three.

357
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,000
The dam will do that if it matches to multiple ASINs for a single SKU.

358
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,720
When we match to an ASIN that has a UOM that's not in each,

359
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,200
we set the UOM of the ASIN and EVP based on the package quantity value of the ASIN.

360
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:36,140
So the system tries to set up the pack two as a pack to an EVP.

361
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,500
So we would match to both, assuming the configuration allowed it now.

362
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,180
If I had the package quantity as one and I only allowed one,

363
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,220
that second match wouldn't occur, ideally,

364
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,500
because the user set up the ASIN with the package quantity of two.

365
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,900
But the system does try to match to multiple listings

366
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,500
and set the UOM based on the ASIN information.

367
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,580
But if there were, in the example I brought up earlier,

368
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:11,100
if a product was sold in three different categories,

369
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,900
would it match to three different listings if all the criteria matched?

370
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,660
Right, yep.

371
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:24,140
And you would end up with a listing where it's the SKU and then the SKU dash two

372
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,420
and then the SKU dash three.

373
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,820
And you would see multiple Amazon listings,

374
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,460
each with its own ASIN stored as an attribute.

375
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:35,420
Okay, here's another one that I pretty sure we covered.

376
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:40,140
Do you recommend the dam only look at in-stock items?

377
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,220
Is it general rule of thumb, yes.

378
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,300
If you're onboarding a new supplier and they haven't sent inventory yet,

379
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,700
that would be a reason not to check stock.

380
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:02,340
If you fulfill an item on demand and you don't have an inventory feed,

381
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,940
you don't want to check stock.

382
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:10,100
But typically, you don't gain much from attaching to an ASIN that you can't sell on.

383
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,260
So, as a rule of thumb, I recommend checking stock in a minimum of one.

384
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,300
Because simply put, if I don't have it to sell, why do I want to be on the ASIN?

385
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,420
Okay.

386
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,100
But again, there may be business scenarios like I don't have an inventory feed

387
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:31,220
or it's not set up yet where that would drive some business context

388
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,620
as to why I don't want to check stock.

389
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,220
And I think the last one here that we haven't covered at any time

390
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,980
during our 40 minutes together was,

391
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:48,740
can we search by manufacturer part number and manufacture?

392
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,180
And not just UPC.

393
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,780
Yes.

394
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,900
Pretty basic one.

395
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,020
Your basic options for searching are UPC and MPN.

396
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:07,620
I can add a secondary check so that remember the manufacturer true, false,

397
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,900
and the matching criteria.

398
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,220
So, by search on MPN, I can also make sure the manufacturer matches.

399
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:18,820
Inversely, I could search on UPC and also make sure the manufacturer matches.

400
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,020
But in terms of, can I just search by MPN and manufacturer?

401
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,340
Yes.

402
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,860
You do not need UPC.

403
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,060
I learned something today.

404
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:29,890
Excellent.

405
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,130
Are there any other questions out there?

406
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,130
If so, type quick.

407
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,030
All right.

408
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,670
Let's talk about next month.

409
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,610
One more slide.

410
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:54,290
Next month, we're pretty early in the month.

411
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,210
August 9th.

412
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:03,730
I know that this is a time of year where certain categories or industries

413
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,890
are maybe taking a little bit more vacation.

414
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:12,610
So, remember, even if you missed the webinar and we brought it up early today,

415
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,770
all this information is stored for you to go back to and review in the future.

416
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:23,650
Most all the videos are there and there's matching documentation

417
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,490
for almost all the different webinars.

418
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,970
We'll be sending out invitations for you to join.

419
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:35,650
We do realize this was prime day.

420
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:39,090
So, I think our numbers might be down a little bit.

421
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,690
That's okay.

422
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:48,130
We're seeing that several of these topics are getting hit multiple times.

423
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,610
I think pricing was the second webinar we did

424
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:58,770
and is still sitting out there as our most watched and re-watched webinars.

425
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:05,330
So, we're really happy that we're getting that kind of new people coming to it

426
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:08,530
and others going back to review what we're doing.

427
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:14,130
In future sessions, we're going to be covering things like monitoring,

428
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,690
everything you want to know about monitoring.

429
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,050
How are we watching what Amazon is doing, what you're doing,

430
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:25,650
what your orders are doing to make sure that your business is operating at peak efficiency?

431
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,450
What are some of the other topics that we'll be handling in the near future,

432
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,050
James, that we've talked about?

433
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,890
The replenishment will be coming up.

434
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,290
Replenishment, I think that's a big one.

435
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,930
We will have a webinar on the web UI at some point.

436
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:51,010
And then I also have material ready to cover shipping cost models and shipping levels.

437
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,450
So, that will be a topic that comes up.

438
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:58,690
Yeah, we're going to easily get through the end of the year

439
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,210
and we're going to keep this going.

440
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:07,170
If we have to, we'll keep going deeper or wider as needed to keep this going

441
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:12,050
so that you can learn as much about the product or relearn.

442
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:17,730
This is great for clients and partners that have been with us since day one

443
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,610
and for the people that we signed on last month.

444
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,170
So, we want to make this as valuable as possible.

445
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,690
Two other things I want to remind you is

446
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:38,130
fill out your quarterly surveys, please, as we want to get better.

447
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:42,450
And the only way we know we're getting better is if you fill out those surveys.

448
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:49,810
And we may even send out a survey on what maybe not next month.

449
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:54,210
I think next month we're kind of locked into a topic based on vacations.

450
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:58,610
But we're also going to give you that opportunity

451
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:03,570
to have some say in what might be the September one.

452
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,770
So, thank you for attending.

453
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:10,290
I hope you are having a fabulous Prime Day.

454
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:15,890
I know my wife has almost bankrupted me over the last two days.

455
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,730
Hopefully, they're your products.

456
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:23,410
And until we see you again, thanks for being our client and partner.
