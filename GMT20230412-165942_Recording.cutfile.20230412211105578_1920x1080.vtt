WEBVTT

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:17.230
Well, thank you for those of you joining us on our second maiden voyage of Tech Edge.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.390
Here it is, April already, and we want to thank you for attending.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.789
We are going to be a very prompt group for this webinar from here on forward, and we're

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.270
going to kick it off now.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.270
So thank you for attending.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.189
Today, we're going to be talking about pricing, or if I screw up badly, how quickly I can

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:43.710
go out of business.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.310
We're going to be focusing on the basics of the ETail pricing and repricing module with

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:00.710
over 100 million Prime users out there today, always on the hunt for a bargain.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:11.069
Even the slightest mistake in pricing can be disastrous for many merchants and sellers.

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:16.069
So today, we're not going to go to the next slide yet, but James and I are going to be

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:18.510
once again your host.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.790
Thank you for attending.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.069
We're going to be going through why you want or need to reprice in the e-commerce sphere

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:28.709
of influence.

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.989
Why is this important?

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:34.310
This is as important as any module we have.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.670
James is going to go through the actual, let's break this apart into basic steps that we

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.829
can walk through for any of those that are not super familiar with our pricing module.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:58.349
From there, we'll talk about some practical applications of it and some already existing

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:03.430
ways to put this into your business environment immediately.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.030
Then we'll get into the question and answer session, and those can come up starting almost

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.509
now, and when appropriate, I will ask them during that section of the webinar, otherwise

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:22.150
we'll leave them towards the end, and then we'll talk a little bit about next month

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.789
and what's going on in Tech Edge.

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:30.750
The one thing I do want to remind you right here and now is there will be a survey at

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.750
the end.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.229
We would love to get your feedback.

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:40.789
Also you get a survey quarterly for me, Tal.

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:42.469
Please fill that out.

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.469
You may have filled that out in the past, but we still want to see you do it every month

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:51.150
to see if we're improving or if we're not.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.189
Also while we already have our session picked out for next month, it's going to be your

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:08.379
chance to give us some feedback on where you would like us to go.

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.099
E-commerce is not just about revenue.

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.500
It's not just about whether you win or lose the buy box.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.539
It's also about protecting your margins.

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:28.300
For those of you that are golfers, you may be familiar with the slogan, you drive for

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.580
show but putt for dough.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:41.219
In e-commerce is revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, and cash is king.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.699
It's all about making sure that we're profitable.

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:50.099
I'll be your host again, and I'm happy to be here with you, and then I have with

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:57.979
me my partner, James Davis, our subject matter expert, and some of yours, a customer success

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:05.379
manager from ETL, and he's going to be taking you through the rest of today.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.620
But always, always, always.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.860
Please questions, questions, questions.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.740
If we're not answering your questions, we're not sure that we're giving you the right

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.420
information, and our one primary goal here is to help you get better.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.339
So with that, let's get started.

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:30.540
We're always going to remind you, why are we here?

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.980
It really is.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:40.339
It isn't about tickets, yes, it's about tickets, but did we help you grow this month?

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:42.819
Did we help you get more profitable this month?

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:48.220
I know we've helped several of our clients by going through and saying, we're selling

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.939
a lot, are we optimized for profitability, and we've had some great results recently.

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.060
Ask your CSM about those kind of working with us.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.579
And James, now it's you.

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:11.379
As Jeff mentioned, the first topic we're really going to dive into is how to think about re-pricing

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.019
in the e-commerce space.

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:18.339
What are the things to be thinking about as you're strategizing at a high level before you

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:22.819
get into the weeds of policies and lookup tables?

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:27.459
So the first thing you want to think about is, am I competing on a competitive marketplace

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:33.279
where there's other sellers, marketplaces like Amazon or Walmart, where you're not the

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:39.879
only seller on that listing, and you're all competing for some version of a buy place?

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:46.420
Or are you re-pricing on an independent marketplace like eBay or Shopify where you don't have other

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:54.519
competitors that the buyer can kind of compare around and other competitors that drive price

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:55.519
changes?

00:05:55.519 --> 00:06:00.879
So that's a very high level thing to consider when you're approaching, how do I re-price?

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.319
What type of marketplace are you on?

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.339
The next most important thing to think about and understand is, what is your business's

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:14.339
competitive differentiator that allows you to get an edge on re-pricing?

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:18.680
If you're a reseller and there's 12 other people selling the same product, how do you

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.459
get a competitive differentiator?

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:27.379
It could be latency, it could be your seller ring, it could be your ability to get inventory

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:32.800
at a premium cost that allows you to have a lower floor than your competitors while

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.100
still making a healthy margin.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.660
But really understanding what allows you to be set apart from the rest.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.699
Do you have an exclusive brand deal so you're the only person who should be selling?

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:50.740
There's a lot of different ways you can get a competitive differentiator, but you want

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:57.740
to understand what you have in your toolkit to give you a competitive edge.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.259
And those are going to be very specific to what your business can achieve with your

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:09.110
relationships with your suppliers, your manufacturers, and so forth.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.350
The next variable to really consider because it feeds directly into re-pricing is shipping

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.949
cost and latency.

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.750
Do you have accurate weight or dim data?

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.810
Are your shipping cost estimates as accurate as possible?

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:31.750
Is your latency as accurate as possible because latency is going to drive your appeal to buyers.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.949
Obviously if it's a great price, but I have to wait a month, I'm not interested because

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:40.550
if I'm on e-commerce, I want it now, I want it in two days.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:46.069
And then with shipping cost, the more accurate you can generate an estimated shipping cost,

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:51.990
the better you can get at squeezing your margin, maximizing your margin, knowing where

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.370
your profit potential is.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.910
Shipping cost is driven off of weight data and dim data.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:04.829
Dim data is always preferred because a lot of carriers will use dim weight over flat weight.

00:08:04.829 --> 00:08:08.389
And again, that lets you get to a more accurate estimated shipping cost.

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:12.629
James, we already have our first question.

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:17.230
What are some of the ways to improve the accuracy of my shipping costs?

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.709
Can I get my shipping costs from my carriers?

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:27.189
So there's two general approaches to getting an accurate shipping cost.

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:34.110
The ideal method is to get your shipping rates from your carriers.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.350
You can typically reach out to your rep and they'll send you an Excel spreadsheet which

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:44.669
has all of your negotiated rates and replicating those in EVP as shipping cost models.

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:49.190
There is some documentation on the Help Center about shipping cost models that you can reference,

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:56.470
but you're essentially replicating your fulfillment costs in shipping cost models that can then

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.629
be leveraged for estimated shipping.

00:08:58.629 --> 00:09:05.509
The secondary method which is also utilized but slightly less ideal is to use a blended

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:07.009
rate table.

00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:10.029
Look at your average shipping costs.

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:16.850
Generate a blended rate table that you know puts you above a minimum threshold.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:24.110
The disadvantage of a blended rate table is, again, you're estimating on top of estimates

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.950
instead of replicating the actual costs with your rate tables.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.389
But putting some time and effort into understanding your shipping cost model setup would be a

00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:35.750
way to get more accurate shipping costs.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.750
Great.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.750
Thank you.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:45.549
Also, if you're leveraging the native shipping workflow in EVP, we capture DIM data during

00:09:45.549 --> 00:09:51.629
shipping label manifesting which can help you get accurate DIM data into the system.

00:09:51.629 --> 00:09:57.649
Because you're leveraging supplier data which isn't as good as, hey, I put it in a box and

00:09:57.649 --> 00:10:01.049
shipped it and this is how big it was, you know, that might be a slightly different than

00:10:01.049 --> 00:10:02.549
what your supplier says.

00:10:02.549 --> 00:10:08.529
So capturing that data in that way is also very effective.

00:10:08.529 --> 00:10:15.710
The next piece of advice I give a lot of my clients is you are the masters of your

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.710
catalog.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.289
I as a CSM can get to know your catalog, but you're going to have the most intimate

00:10:20.289 --> 00:10:22.110
relationship with it.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:27.070
You want to be able to look at your catalog at a macro level in terms of large category

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.110
sets.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:34.409
For example, this break kits can come in the range of 1,000 SKUs.

00:10:34.409 --> 00:10:39.649
It's more prudent to tackle those at a macro level.

00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:45.909
How do I want all of these repricing versus going how does an individual break kit

00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:47.289
reprice?

00:10:47.289 --> 00:10:52.129
On the flip side, I may want to look at my top 20 selling items and really focus

00:10:52.129 --> 00:10:55.490
individually on those SKUs and their repricing behavior.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.730
But if I have 10,000 SKUs, I can't focus individually on each one.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.570
So you need to be able to understand where it makes sense to slice and dice your

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:10.710
catalog in terms of large groups, individual SKUs, and sort of small subsets of

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.110
high volume SKUs.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:19.850
So it really is a precursor to effective repricing is knowing where it makes sense

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.169
to slice and dice your catalog.

00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:28.110
In the out of motive space, spark plugs, you typically need to be isolated

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.490
because of repricing nuances.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.450
But there are many ways to understand the catalog and you will

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:39.169
understand it best, but you want to think about where do I need to isolate

00:11:39.169 --> 00:11:44.029
items because they're very competitive and they're high volume and I need their

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:50.149
own repricing structure versus well, I can put these 25,000 items and look at

00:11:50.149 --> 00:11:57.990
them at a macro level because they're slower volume, they are UPP price and

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.549
force, so there's not much options in terms of behavior, things like that.

00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:07.710
But really understanding where it makes sense to group your catalog is

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.710
very important.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:16.269
The trap many people call them to is I'm going to focus on individual SKUs only and

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:20.070
they never back up into the macro level.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:26.070
And these are all great topics to go over with your CSM and go, how would you break

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.990
up my catalog?

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:35.830
How do I identify those top selling products, whether it's the top 20 or the top 5 or 10%?

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.429
Let's go in and take a look at your catalog together and find those areas where we can

00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:44.269
have the biggest impact on your business.

00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:51.029
You have a lot of reports available to identify that information, but it's important to have

00:12:51.029 --> 00:12:59.450
an idea of those nuances as you're going into what am I doing with repricing.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.090
Having business objectives is a really good goal.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.490
Oftentimes I ask clients what the results they are looking for and they say I want

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.570
to win the buy box.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:13.570
While that is a business objective, it's very generic and hard to sort of measure success

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.570
again.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:19.529
So you can look at your buy box percent, but I encourage people to go, I want to sell 10%

00:13:19.529 --> 00:13:22.690
more of this product category this month than last month.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:32.929
Or I want to generate sales via having products on a discount to see the, you know, maybe

00:13:32.929 --> 00:13:37.009
I sell it at a lower margin, but I'm selling more of it.

00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:42.490
So I end up with a higher total profit, but having a defined business objective that can

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:48.529
be a measure of success is good and getting away from the obsession of the buy box.

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:54.649
It's important to win the buy box, but you want to apply strategies in such a way that

00:13:54.649 --> 00:13:58.929
the outcome isn't just you're in the buy box because you can have the buy box and

00:13:58.929 --> 00:14:03.009
not make sales just as easily as you can have the buy box and make sales.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:09.889
So defining your business objective is a good place to start at the beginning of this process.

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:12.370
You can win the buy box and lose money.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:17.570
Yes, you can win the buy box and lose money and that's, you know, another good example

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:23.110
of what's your objective really is selling more of this product, improving your margin

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:30.669
on this product and increasing volume of a certain subset of products.

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:35.149
The next thing I encourage customers to do, your clients to do is to always be monitoring

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:36.950
the competition.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.509
There's a million different repricers out there, but they're all based on the same

00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:44.669
technology and what you will find is you'll apply a strategy.

00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:50.210
It may drive sales up for a week, a month, a quarter, but at some point your competitors

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:56.690
repricer will capture what you're doing and apply a counter strategy.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.409
And so it's never good to set up strategies in Q1 and forget about them.

00:15:01.409 --> 00:15:07.210
It requires constant monitoring and analysis and making adjustments.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:12.850
And so looking at what your competitors are doing can help you understand where those

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.690
adjustments may need to occur.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:27.950
But again, it's important to understand what the competition is doing to your price and

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:36.509
whether it's important to respond to their price events or maybe you want to ignore them

00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:39.990
because they're just manipulating your price, but you have to kind of understand what they're

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.990
doing.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.269
And then again, analyzing and adjusting.

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:50.070
I always making a change to repricing, giving it two to three weeks to see the behavior and

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.070
then making adjustments.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.429
But you want to constantly be reviewing and adjusting and I'll show you how you can do

00:15:56.429 --> 00:15:59.110
that effectively shortly.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:03.990
But again, these are the high level mindsets and considerations you should have as you

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.470
approach repricing and e-commerce.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.190
So the repricing basics and EVP.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:15.429
The very first thing you're going to start with is selection criteria.

00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:19.350
Then there's some basic configuration that must be in place to allow automatic repricing

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.230
to occur.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:28.230
Go over what a pricing formula is and what its functions are and some of the options you

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.309
have there.

00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:36.710
Some basic price policy configuration options that can affect behavior.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.549
Then I'll discuss controllers and triggers and their functions.

00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:47.110
AppTables is a currently under leveraged feature, which I will explain how it works in tandem

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:55.950
with pricing formula to achieve a lot of complexity and nuance in a very simple structure.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.710
And lastly, I will discuss the repricing result screen, which needs to be leveraged

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:04.900
to do that analysis and adjustment.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:10.059
So selection criteria is used in various parts of the system in EVP, but what it is is it's

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:13.700
a logic statement that defines a group of SKUs.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:19.859
And the reason it's important to have a grasp on how selection criteria can work and how

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:23.980
simple or nuanced it can get is because many times a client will approach me and say,

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.779
I want these items to reprice them this way.

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:31.460
And the first question I ask is, how do I identify those items systematically with

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.299
selection criteria?

00:17:33.299 --> 00:17:38.240
I can obviously go through 10,000 SKUs and assign them manually, but that is ineffective.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.960
So you need to be able to identify groups of SKUs with selection criteria.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.440
This example on the screen is very simple.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.279
It's just saying an Amazon record exists.

00:17:49.279 --> 00:17:52.200
I match that criteria if that's true.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.240
But I can get as nuanced as it weighs greater than a certain amount, has a certain manufacturer

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.900
and a certain supplier record is present.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:06.960
So your ability to nuance selection criteria defines your ability to nuance your pricing

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.960
policies.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.920
It's important to familiarize yourselves with the options available.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:18.000
I encourage you to present a scenario and then work with your CSM to get the selection

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.960
criteria correct.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:27.279
But knowing the selection criteria limitations will help you from kind of putting out, oh,

00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:29.240
I want to identify the items in this way.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.839
It's not possible because selection criteria doesn't have that function.

00:18:32.839 --> 00:18:37.299
So knowing the functions of selection criteria is important.

00:18:37.299 --> 00:18:43.180
And then what selection criteria will do will automatically assign items to enabled policies.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.579
So this checkbox is here.

00:18:44.579 --> 00:18:47.539
It's also up in the corner over here on the full screen.

00:18:47.539 --> 00:18:52.299
But if this box is checked and the other configuration options that I'll mention a

00:18:52.299 --> 00:19:00.269
second there, we will use this selection criteria to assign an item to the policy.

00:19:00.269 --> 00:19:05.869
So to allow automatic repricing, the following conditions must be true.

00:19:05.869 --> 00:19:08.549
Automatic pricing must be enabled on the SKU.

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:09.710
That's right here.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.730
This is enabled by default.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:17.109
You can manipulate and adjust this using the bulk updater on the sales channel screen.

00:19:17.109 --> 00:19:21.269
So if you want to disable a group of listings or enable a group of listings, you can do

00:19:21.269 --> 00:19:22.710
it in bulk.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.549
You don't have to go through individually.

00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:29.309
A pricing policy with matching selection criteria must be enabled.

00:19:29.309 --> 00:19:33.309
Again, the selection criteria is used to automatically assign an item.

00:19:33.309 --> 00:19:39.190
So if it can't be assigned, then it can't be associated to a policy to use.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.630
Most people will find they'll click reprice.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.569
It'll say no matching price policy.

00:19:43.569 --> 00:19:49.789
That means you don't have a selection criteria option that would meet that specific SKU.

00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:53.269
So that's an important thing to have in place.

00:19:53.269 --> 00:19:55.869
An item must have publishable inventory.

00:19:55.869 --> 00:20:03.470
This is also important to know if there's no inventory to publish, then the system cannot

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:08.150
reprice due to the way the logic and EDP works and how the system kind of estimates

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.670
shipping and exposes inventory.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:18.589
So it's important to make sure you have some exposed inventory if you are looking for repricing

00:20:18.589 --> 00:20:20.730
to occur.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.609
And then an item must have weight and or DIM data.

00:20:23.609 --> 00:20:26.829
This is because a shipping cost has to be generated.

00:20:26.829 --> 00:20:29.549
Technically you could have a shipping override as well.

00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:32.309
But obviously the ideal is to have DIM data.

00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:35.750
So DIM weight can be calculated and you can have the most accurate shipping costs.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.230
And as I mentioned before, the more accurate your shipping cost, the more accurate and

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.150
tighter your margins can get.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:50.910
James, it seems like while as robust and powerful as this is, if you just take a very structured

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:57.390
approach to it, you just can kind of follow the steps.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:03.029
You know, clearly talk to your CSM, but it's pretty logical things that it's asking

00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:04.029
for.

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:05.029
Yeah.

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:08.269
Then again, what I'm covering in this slide are the pillars.

00:21:08.269 --> 00:21:13.869
Once you have a grasp of these concepts, you have background knowledge to engage in a meaningful

00:21:13.869 --> 00:21:17.039
conversation with your CSM.

00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:18.039
Yeah.

00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:22.900
And I've talked to some of our clients that early on, they didn't have all their weight,

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.720
so they just threw some numbers in during implementation.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.839
And you really do need to go back and check those and get good data in those selections.

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:34.559
Yeah.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:37.559
Cash is king, but so is data.

00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:38.559
There you go.

00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:41.039
You want up to me.

00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:45.640
Pricing formula, conceptually very basic.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:51.240
Your floor and ceiling set the upper and lower price ranges and your target sets your

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.200
ideal price range.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:59.640
Target is used on independent marketplaces like Shopify and eBay as a starting price.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.640
I start there.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.119
And then I may have mechanisms, which I'll cover in a sec, that drive the price up or

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:09.400
down, and I will never go below my floor above my ceiling.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.680
Target is also used on competitive marketplaces like Amazon if you're the only person on

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.680
the ASIN.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.119
If you're alone on an ASIN, we'll start at your target.

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:23.319
And then again, there may be functions that drive the price up or down.

00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:25.359
Pricing policies utilize tokens.

00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:28.079
Be familiar with the tokens available.

00:22:28.079 --> 00:22:32.880
P tokens are dynamically looking up that variable for that skew at that specific

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.559
point in time, returning it to the formula and then doing the calculation.

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:41.680
So again, if I don't have accurate shipping cost estimates, I'm not going to be able

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.079
to have an accurate margin.

00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:50.480
So that's why getting your shipping cost as accurate as possible is very important.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.680
You know, and again, item cost, we'll look at the supplier channel or the

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.400
ETL channel that has the inventory exposed at that time, based on all of your

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.079
priorities, configuration for each location.

00:23:03.079 --> 00:23:06.880
And again, that can be a big competitive differentiator is that I get the items at

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.799
a better cost.

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:10.079
Therefore, I can have a lower floor.

00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:11.599
I can have a better price.

00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:14.890
I can get more sales.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:19.769
But each policy will have its own set of pricing formula, and they will all

00:23:19.769 --> 00:23:28.140
utilize tokens and then basic order operation and math functions.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:35.059
Some basic price policy configuration options to be aware of an EVP.

00:23:35.059 --> 00:23:37.779
First, relative amount.

00:23:37.779 --> 00:23:43.339
I'll cover seeking in a moment, but your two options for adjusting your price in a

00:23:43.339 --> 00:23:47.019
competitive way are relative amount or you seek.

00:23:47.019 --> 00:23:50.099
A relative amount is used on a collective marketplace.

00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:54.420
And because there's other sellers, we can look at and make a price adjustment

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.900
based on their price.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.420
So a relative amount on an Amazon price policy looks like this here.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:07.059
And I can reprice by an amount or a percent based on the type of seller.

00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:11.019
So if I'm competing against Amazon, I may want to just adjust by a penny because

00:24:11.019 --> 00:24:14.299
Amazon's biased and will give themself the buy box.

00:24:14.299 --> 00:24:18.339
But if I'm competing against a merchant, I may want to beat them by 10 cents

00:24:18.339 --> 00:24:22.900
because I know that that range will kick them out of the buy box and give it to

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.859
me and then FBA.

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:31.500
Similar understanding the nuance of your FBA competition will let you know,

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.460
should I adjust by a lot, a little?

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:40.059
Should I maybe I price above FBA because my latency is better and that could be a

00:24:40.059 --> 00:24:41.740
way to win the buy box.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.740
And then this one down here is Walmart.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.539
We have less information provided by Walmart, but we can still adjust the

00:24:47.539 --> 00:24:49.660
price by a relative amount.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.900
An important thing to understand here is if these numbers are positive,

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.660
I will adjust above.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.859
So if I want to adjust below, I need to make sure these numbers are negative.

00:24:58.859 --> 00:25:04.339
If they are at zero, then we match the price that the competitors have.

00:25:04.339 --> 00:25:09.380
The second repricing configuration option that is available and you should be

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.420
aware of is price parity.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:16.339
Simply put, price parity is where we copy the price on one channel and put it on another.

00:25:16.339 --> 00:25:20.180
You can copy it and adjust it by an amount.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:25.539
This has been used historically to allow marketplaces with competition to help

00:25:25.539 --> 00:25:31.220
drive the price on marketplaces without competition.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:36.619
For example, eBay has competitors, so the price is adjusting all the time.

00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:37.339
eBay doesn't.

00:25:37.339 --> 00:25:46.240
So I may have my eBay price be driven by what's occurring on Amazon.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.519
And then within price policies, you'll see options to ignore price

00:25:49.519 --> 00:25:55.599
parity if needed, but the general idea being that one marketplace doesn't have

00:25:55.599 --> 00:25:58.400
price drivers and the other does.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.480
And just like last month, all this information is going to be available so

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.920
that you can rewatch the webinar here.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:14.920
You'll be able to go through the PowerPoints and James has prepared some

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:21.599
really good documentation that goes into these in a little bit greater depth to

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:26.680
partner with the digital assets that we are providing.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.640
So I encourage you to rewatch this and then review the material.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.119
As I did last time, I put out a series of questions that you should be able to

00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:39.440
answer after reviewing the material and answering the questions demonstrates you

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.640
have the knowledge to understand the basics.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:47.640
So you can A, take a stab at it yourself and B, independent self-enabled and B,

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.799
engage in a conversation with your CSM where they're not having to kind of go,

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:53.519
well, we can't achieve that in that way.

00:26:53.519 --> 00:26:57.400
You need to ask it in a different way.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:03.519
So one of the first more advanced functions of a pricing policy are controllers and triggers.

00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:08.839
They're available on each policy on all channels.

00:27:08.839 --> 00:27:14.119
A controller is a behavior.

00:27:14.119 --> 00:27:18.480
So I want the price to behave in a certain way.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.880
There are two options that are readily available and utilized.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.880
One is seek, as I mentioned, you can either use a relative amount to adjust your

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.799
price based on what the other sellers are doing, or I can seek, which is simply

00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:35.359
adjusting by an amount up or down over a fixed period of time.

00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:39.160
Steep can be used on a marketplace like eBay where you don't have a price

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.759
driver, so I'm just seeking down until I start seeing sales or I'm seeking up

00:27:43.759 --> 00:27:48.759
until my sales fall below a certain threshold.

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:53.319
The second controller option is hold, pretty self-explanatory.

00:27:53.319 --> 00:27:58.400
If a policy has the hold controller set up, we hold that price.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.920
I'll explain a bit more about some pricing policy loops that utilize that,

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.039
but essentially it's most heavily used when you want to hold a price such as

00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:14.799
I've won the buy box, hold that price until I lose the buy box or an items on a

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:19.319
promotional, so I want it to hold the price so I get items into a policy and

00:28:19.319 --> 00:28:22.440
then it just holds the price.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.640
On top of controllers, we have triggers.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:30.400
Triggers are a marketplace or price event.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:37.799
Something happens on the marketplace or something happens in the EVP

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:42.480
that triggers a response, so a very obvious one is I win the buy box.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:50.190
If I win the buy box, I want something to happen to the SKU in terms of how it's pricing.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:56.950
The function of a trigger is that event occurs and the item is moved to a new policy,

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:03.150
so the idea being that if I'm seeking down for five hours, or in this case,

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:08.470
12 hours, I then want to move it to a new rule because if I haven't won the buy box

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.630
after seeking down for 12 hours, I want to apply a different strategy.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:16.710
Maybe I use relative amount after that period of time, so it allows you to move items

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:21.549
in between different rules as these marketplace events occur,

00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:25.670
and then in tandem with controllers, which affect price.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.630
Couples look really interesting, James.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:31.670
I like the idea of stock age.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:38.190
If I've had something for 45, 60 days and I'm not seeing any movement on it

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:43.230
and I'm trying to manage 10,000 or 100,000 SKUs,

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:50.309
just let the system start pricing that so that I actually free up some inventory and capital.

00:29:50.309 --> 00:29:55.230
Yeah, I'll cover it in a sec, but we've seen results with a FBA stock age loop,

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:58.430
so as your FBA inventory gets older, you offer it at a better price,

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:03.430
and that's been effective at selling the inventory as it ages.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:08.269
Sales velocity is a big one, which I'll cover.

00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:13.710
But again, being familiar with these options and what they do allows you to engage

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:18.750
in a meaningful conversation with the CSM and also enables you to kind of know,

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.349
this is what the system can do for me, and this is what it can't.

00:30:22.349 --> 00:30:29.309
And so you apply strategies that are enforceable versus coming up with ideas

00:30:29.309 --> 00:30:32.390
that you struggle to implement.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:34.630
Two important notes about triggers.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.589
Triggers can move items to policies that are not enabled.

00:30:37.589 --> 00:30:41.990
So if you remember on the slide before, I said selection criteria is used

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.910
to assign items to policies that are enabled.

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:48.470
A policy can not have that checkbox and still be utilized,

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:54.470
but what that typically indicates is a trigger is moving a SKU to that policy

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:57.349
after it's been assigned via selection criteria.

00:30:57.349 --> 00:31:02.549
So I have a default policy that captures the SKU selection criteria,

00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:06.950
and then I have a trigger event which moves it to a policy that's not enabled.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:11.509
So when you're looking at your repricing policies, don't necessarily think

00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:14.750
because that checkbox is not there, it means the rule doesn't be used.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:20.430
It could be that SKUs only get there because a trigger moved it there.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.710
The second thing to understand and know is a trigger can move a SKU

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:27.150
to a policy with no formula.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:32.829
In this scenario, the formula from the policy it moved from are inherited,

00:31:32.829 --> 00:31:36.390
and this can be used in a number of ways.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:44.269
But the main one is I define my floor, ceiling, and target within my default policy,

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:49.190
and then I may have a secondary default policy for a subcategory of products,

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.829
defining their floor, target, and ceiling.

00:31:51.829 --> 00:31:56.750
Both those rules have triggers which move items into a SQL.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:32:03.069
Now, the SQL doesn't have formula, so it doesn't redefine the target floor and ceiling,

00:32:03.069 --> 00:32:06.190
and you don't need two different SQLs with formula

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:10.309
because they're being inherited as their move.

00:32:10.309 --> 00:32:15.309
And again, work with your CSM, they can demonstrate this in some working examples,

00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:18.230
but it is important to note, I have many people ask,

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:21.829
oh, that policy doesn't have formula, is it not working?

00:32:21.829 --> 00:32:23.549
That may not be the case.

00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:33.559
It may be that the expectation is the formula is inherited as the items move by a trigger.

00:32:33.559 --> 00:32:38.720
Also, Ramon, remind everyone, keep those questions coming in

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:44.119
so that we have a very lively question and answer session at the end of this.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:52.759
The lookup tables are the newest function that's been added to the repricing toolkit,

00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:56.519
and it's utilized to determine your margin.

00:32:56.519 --> 00:33:00.960
Historically, we found people setting up 20 different policies,

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:08.319
and the only reason they had 20 policies is they had some factor impacting the margin ranges,

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:09.880
oftentimes cost.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.960
So you'd have a zero through 10 rule and a 10 through 15 and a 15 through 20 and 20.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:21.000
And it was very difficult to manage 50 different rules for different cost ranges.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:30.759
So we added lookup tables as a way to dynamically calculate margin based on SKU conditions.

00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:35.440
So as you can see here in this formula, the margin is 0.9.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.559
So I'm always going to calculate a 10% margin.

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:43.440
But as many of you know, I don't always need a 10% margin.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.359
Sometimes I can get five, sometimes I need 20.

00:33:46.359 --> 00:33:52.519
There's conditions around a SKU that kind of impact what margin is appropriate.

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:55.880
And so you can see in this formula, instead of having to fix number,

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.960
I have this big long string of text.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.920
And all this is doing is telling the formula to look at a lookup table,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.720
in this case, the margin floor table,

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.280
and then use the item cost to return a number.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:17.119
So it allows you, again, to dynamically adjust your margin within a single price policy.

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:26.199
And this helps you have a simple pricing policy structure that's focused on behavior and response to events.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:34.980
And then you let lookup tables handle all of the nuances of this impacts margin and that impacts margin.

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:41.340
So you first start off at a table, as I showed before, the table is defined in the formula.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.539
So here I go to the floor margin.

00:34:45.539 --> 00:34:48.260
I then look at a dimension.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.059
Dimension is selection criteria.

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:54.219
Again, I emphasize this is why it's really important to know how selection criteria works

00:34:54.219 --> 00:35:01.059
and what's capable and what's not capable of selection criteria.

00:35:01.059 --> 00:35:04.219
Because in here is a very simple example.

00:35:04.219 --> 00:35:09.420
I'm just looking at, am I selling it from my stock or am I selling it from my stock?

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:17.219
And then I'm able to return two different margin values depending on which condition is true.

00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:22.059
The value column, I have a bigger screenshot of this slide, so you'll see it in a sec.

00:35:22.059 --> 00:35:24.059
But this column says value.

00:35:24.059 --> 00:35:26.860
This is the cost of the item.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.460
This column is amount.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:34.139
This will be the number returned to the formula based on which dimension path we went down

00:35:34.139 --> 00:35:37.900
and based on what the cost of the item is at the time of repricing.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.460
So again, we start with a table.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.699
We identify which dimension the skew would match.

00:35:43.699 --> 00:35:46.619
Again, this is all selection criteria based.

00:35:46.619 --> 00:35:50.539
Then we return an amount based on a value.

00:35:50.539 --> 00:35:57.699
And again, the goal here is that the factors and nuances that impact your margin are handled

00:35:57.699 --> 00:36:06.179
in lookup tables so that your pricing policies can be, the number of pricing policy you need is reduced

00:36:06.179 --> 00:36:12.179
and they're focused on price behavior and response to marketplace events rather than

00:36:12.179 --> 00:36:19.449
handling margin, price behavior, and response to marketplace events.

00:36:19.449 --> 00:36:24.369
So just to recap, you have a pricing policy that either is using controllers and triggers

00:36:24.369 --> 00:36:29.250
relative amount of price parity to handle the behavior of your price on the marketplace.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:34.650
And then you use lookup tables to dynamically adjust your margin within a price policy.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:41.250
And when you have this set up and all the facets are working together, you have a really

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:48.570
powerful repricing toolkit that, while it might not seem simple at first, once you understand

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:52.809
each piece, it makes a lot of sense and it will click and you will go, oh, I need to

00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:53.809
adjust my margin.

00:36:53.809 --> 00:36:57.849
I'm going to my lookup table and I need to adjust my margin for stock, so I'm going

00:36:57.849 --> 00:37:00.769
to go to the stock dimension and adjust those numbers.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:08.449
Oh, I need to, I want to get more competitive with the rate I seek down.

00:37:08.449 --> 00:37:13.809
Oh, I'm going to my price policy and adjusting my controller and setting the rate to be faster

00:37:13.809 --> 00:37:19.369
or adding a policy that has a trigger that moves it and I have seek rate fast and seek

00:37:19.369 --> 00:37:21.010
rate slow.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:28.929
But again, you want to handle behavior and response in the price policy and the nuances

00:37:28.929 --> 00:37:31.369
of margin and lookup tables.

00:37:31.369 --> 00:37:39.730
And James, I think these webinars do a great job of highlighting, showcasing some of the

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:45.849
changes we've made to the software that maybe not all our clients are aware of and how

00:37:45.849 --> 00:37:52.409
they can use it, a positive impact on their business to drive the revenue while still

00:37:52.409 --> 00:37:53.809
protecting the margins.

00:37:54.809 --> 00:37:59.369
Listen again, my goal here is to give you the knowledge to engage in a conversation while

00:37:59.369 --> 00:38:01.849
also being, you know, self-sufficient with repricing.

00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:08.210
There's no reason you can't be in control of your own destiny when it comes to repricing

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:09.210
an EVP.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:17.090
I'm going to go through this last slide relatively quickly, but oftentimes what I find is people

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:22.090
are looking at the repricing results on the SKU and they're on the repricing tab of

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.090
the SKU.

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:27.610
This gives you very basic details and I don't encourage using that screen except to maybe

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:28.610
check a price.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:33.289
You should train yourself to use the repricing results screen to understand repricing results

00:38:33.289 --> 00:38:36.769
and do that analysis and adjust.

00:38:36.769 --> 00:38:42.090
A pro tip to make that more efficient for you is to select a channel.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:46.289
Each repricing results screen is channel dependent.

00:38:46.289 --> 00:38:52.170
Set up filters and columns that make sense for analyzing a broad group of items or a

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:56.889
specific group of items on sale or items within a certain policy and then save those

00:38:56.889 --> 00:39:01.690
views so that you can reference them later, that other team members can look at them and

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.610
not have to recreate your views.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:10.010
The more views you have, the easier it will be for you to do that analysis and adjustment.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:14.730
Some important metrics to look at on the repricing results screen, price changes,

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:16.730
cost changes.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:20.250
Does the item have a UPP that's limiting my floor?

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.730
What is my floor and ceiling?

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:24.369
Could those be expanded?

00:39:24.369 --> 00:39:25.610
What's the comparison price?

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:30.929
Is it way below my floor and then there's no reason I can't compete at all?

00:39:30.929 --> 00:39:35.170
Is it within the realm of possibility that I compete with that price?

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:36.170
Who's the competitor?

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:43.170
It shows you the last re-price event, the shipping price used at the time of calculation.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:44.210
Is that accurate?

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:45.449
Can that be adjusted?

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:51.090
Is there a reason it's not accurate, such as inaccurate DIMM data?

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.489
A really important one is price policy changes.

00:39:54.489 --> 00:39:58.650
You will see the item moving between price policies and that really tells you the narrative

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:02.650
of how effectively your triggers and controllers are working.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:08.730
An example would be I can work with your CSM to look at the repricing results screen

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.929
in your system because the data is client specific.

00:40:11.929 --> 00:40:17.489
I haven't shown anything in terms of the details, but you can see a, oh, I won the

00:40:17.489 --> 00:40:18.489
buy box.

00:40:18.489 --> 00:40:22.489
And then I lost the buy box, so I started seeking down and I seek down to a certain price

00:40:22.489 --> 00:40:23.809
and that got me the buy box.

00:40:23.809 --> 00:40:27.489
And then I was in the buy box for an hour and I started seeking up.

00:40:27.489 --> 00:40:31.170
You can see that narrative play out in the repricing results screen.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:37.739
And so it's important to leverage this screen when you're doing that analysis.

00:40:37.739 --> 00:40:38.739
As I mentioned-

00:40:38.739 --> 00:40:44.179
James, a quick one that I think kind of fits in right there.

00:40:44.179 --> 00:40:53.820
Why the commission is out of the formula and you put it at the end, I'm not sure.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.820
He's talking about-

00:40:54.820 --> 00:41:01.110
Well, we're going way back.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.510
Right.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.750
So he's talking about having a like plus commission here.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.510
That's really a business decision.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:16.070
But what that means is I'm not putting, I'm not, my total cost doesn't include commission.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:21.389
So I find out my total cost, I figure out my margin based on those total costs, and then

00:41:21.389 --> 00:41:23.750
I add my commission on top of that.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:27.429
Because the commission could vary by where you're selling also.

00:41:27.429 --> 00:41:28.429
Yes.

00:41:28.429 --> 00:41:33.070
Alternatively, you could have permission be included in your total cost basis.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:37.230
It's really a business decision on whether you handle commission as part of your total

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:42.949
cost basis or you add it at the end.

00:41:42.949 --> 00:41:47.309
Some people offer free shipping, so they exclude the shipping cost token because they don't

00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:51.030
need that in their price.

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:55.710
Or they take their item cost, adjust that by a margin, take their shipping cost, adjust

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:57.590
that by a margin.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:06.030
And then, so it's just a nuance in the way you're calculating your margin and adding

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:09.599
on those additional variables.

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:14.559
So some examples of price policy and structures that I've set up that have been successful.

00:42:14.559 --> 00:42:20.519
FBA Stockage Loop, very simply use the stockage trigger, move an item to a different policy

00:42:20.519 --> 00:42:24.280
with the lower floor as the stockage increases.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.880
Sales Velocity Seek Loop, you utilize the sales velocity trigger.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:33.840
You set an upper and lower threshold for what you consider high and low sales.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.639
If you have low sales, you move your seek down policy.

00:42:36.639 --> 00:42:40.960
And if you have high sales, you move your seek up, either trying to lower your margin

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:45.000
to the point where people are buying or increasing your margin to maximize how much money you

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.639
make as people are buying.

00:42:46.639 --> 00:42:51.840
And then, within the seek down, you can have additional triggers to reevaluate.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:56.559
But you're essentially, you're finding a, you're either not selling the item, you

00:42:56.559 --> 00:43:02.719
seek down, so you find a price point that it sells at, and you start selling it.

00:43:02.719 --> 00:43:07.119
Or you're selling a lot of it, and you want to see how much you can increase the price

00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:08.800
before the sales decrease.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:14.800
And then the whole buy box loop is a classic Amazon behavior, but essentially you either

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.599
use relative amount or a seek function.

00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:23.559
And if you win the buy box, you hold the price, and then sometimes you have a timer

00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:27.199
trigger which says after an hour, if I'm still in the buy box, increase the price till

00:43:27.199 --> 00:43:28.480
I lose it.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.559
But essentially, if I lose the buy box, I then respond by lowering my price until I win

00:43:33.559 --> 00:43:35.880
it again.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:41.599
So if you're interested in any of these three different loops being part of your environment,

00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:50.239
talk to your CSM, James, it looks like we've exposed a tremendous amount of power, a tremendous

00:43:50.239 --> 00:43:59.360
amount of capability and flexibility, but in, I'm going to use an old Marvel movie reference

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:04.800
from Spider-Man with great response, with great power comes great responsibility.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:10.519
If you have any questions on how this works or what you're trying to accomplish, or what

00:44:10.519 --> 00:44:16.320
is that business goal, please talk to your CSM.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:21.519
As much power as you're bringing to bear, you can all, we don't want to make mistakes.

00:44:21.519 --> 00:44:24.280
So that's where we are.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:31.440
I'm looking for other, more questions as we get into our Q&A session.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:35.519
Well this one, thank you, this is pretty cool, how do I learn more?

00:44:35.519 --> 00:44:45.519
I think we've said it about a half dozen times, just talk to Jason or Jeff or James or myself

00:44:45.519 --> 00:44:52.760
or whoever your CSM here is here at ETail Solutions.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:45:00.079
We love focusing on these kind of topics to improve the business and really getting you

00:45:00.079 --> 00:45:01.440
to where you're going.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:07.059
We want to make you smart enough to go it alone, but we want to give you enough reasons

00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:12.599
to work with us that you don't have to and know that there's somebody with you all the

00:45:12.599 --> 00:45:15.260
way.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.760
Are there any other questions?

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.159
I think we do.

00:45:20.159 --> 00:45:27.519
I got to keep clicking around to get them in here.

00:45:27.519 --> 00:45:36.920
If we cannot match or beat the buy box price item at floor, can we yo-yo on a schedule to

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.039
trick the algorithms?

00:45:39.039 --> 00:45:44.679
Yeah, so what that question is getting at is, as many people know on those competitive

00:45:44.679 --> 00:45:49.639
marketplaces it's a race condition of the floor and then everyone sits at their lowest price

00:45:49.639 --> 00:45:56.199
and what many people figured out is everyone's using an automated repricer, so I jump my price

00:45:56.199 --> 00:46:02.199
up really high, everyone follows me and kind of prices a penny below my really high price.

00:46:02.199 --> 00:46:06.280
It starts working your way down again, but everybody's making a little bit more for a

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280
while.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:14.639
Well, you pull everyone up off the floor because you can win the buy box with the

00:46:14.639 --> 00:46:20.639
higher price if your latency is good, but essentially you do want to evaluate our items

00:46:20.639 --> 00:46:26.199
just sitting at the floor and there is a trigger that says at floor price, you can then have

00:46:26.199 --> 00:46:34.159
a behavior occur and say, hey, instead of sitting at my floor, seek up by an excessive

00:46:34.159 --> 00:46:38.960
amount for an hour and see if that changes the behavior of the buy box and then put

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.400
it back in a seek down after I went way up.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:49.639
Or you can go, oh, I'm at the floor, oftentimes with relative amount, if you can't beat anyone

00:46:49.639 --> 00:46:54.599
with the relative amount adjustments, you default to your floor.

00:46:54.599 --> 00:46:58.880
So if you find that occurring, have a trigger in your relative amount rule that says if

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:04.519
at floor, move it to a seek rule that elevates your price up above your floor and start

00:47:04.519 --> 00:47:06.400
seeking the price.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:14.099
And again, it's all about applying different strategies that all work in tandem with each

00:47:14.099 --> 00:47:17.739
other via the loops that's driven by the triggers.

00:47:17.739 --> 00:47:24.900
So yes, you can achieve a sort of yo-yoing effect that drives the price up and down.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.019
Here's another one, James.

00:47:26.019 --> 00:47:33.099
Do all these features work for my Shopify and Walmart marketplaces?

00:47:33.099 --> 00:47:38.780
Controllers, triggers, and lookup tables work on all sales channels.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:43.059
What triggers are available will be dependent on the marketplace.

00:47:43.059 --> 00:47:47.340
For example, eBay doesn't have a buy box, so there's no buy box trigger.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.340
Got it.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:55.659
And then Amazon and Walmart will have slightly nuanced repricing configuration options because

00:47:55.659 --> 00:47:58.059
of the data they provide.

00:47:58.059 --> 00:48:04.500
But the core structure behind triggers, controllers, and lookup tables and price formula work with

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.500
all channels.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.820
And I'm sorry to say this is going to have to be our last one because we're actually

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.659
over a little bit.

00:48:12.659 --> 00:48:32.730
What is the advanced tab inside of the pricing policy screen used for?

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:37.369
You may remember I mentioned custom scripts about catalog in the catalog source webinar.

00:48:37.369 --> 00:48:38.849
That's a similar idea.

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:47.250
You can work with your CSM to have the product team build a custom script that initiates

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:49.489
a certain type of behavior.

00:48:49.489 --> 00:48:51.889
It'd be a very nuanced scenario that would.

00:48:51.889 --> 00:48:52.889
Very specialized.

00:48:52.889 --> 00:48:57.369
You'd reach the conclusion that you couldn't achieve that behavior with the functions available

00:48:57.369 --> 00:48:59.530
and we would write a custom script.

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:00.530
Okay.

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:01.809
But yeah.

00:49:01.809 --> 00:49:08.130
And again, my goal here was to give you the knowledge to A, kind of take a stab at yourself

00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:12.329
and B, engage in a meaningful conversation with your CSM where you can present ideas

00:49:12.329 --> 00:49:17.809
that can be implemented versus me having to go, well, that's not quite how the system

00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:20.730
works, so I can't achieve that.

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:21.730
That's reasonable.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:22.730
All right.

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:29.289
And I encourage you to look at the supplementary material, see if you can answer those questions,

00:49:29.289 --> 00:49:34.329
and then reach out to your CSM and have them set up a session to review a bit more in depth

00:49:34.329 --> 00:49:39.730
in your system because there can be a lot more learned about the re-pricing results screen

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.130
and what you have in place when you dive into your specifics.

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:49.280
Can we get to the next screen then as we wrap this up, James?

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:57.239
So once again, second Wednesday of the month, that means that next month it's going to

00:49:57.239 --> 00:49:59.559
be on May 10th.

00:49:59.559 --> 00:50:07.940
Right now, we believe we're going to focus on Dam or excuse me, Dam dynamic auto-matching.

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:15.960
How do you add a large number of SKUs safely into your Amazon marketplace?

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.679
And we'll go into that.

00:50:17.679 --> 00:50:23.800
But once again, on your survey, if there's a topic that is of greater importance to the

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.480
majority of you, that's what we'll do.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:31.719
That's how we got to pricing this month, was because of your feedback.

00:50:31.719 --> 00:50:35.880
Also, remember your quarterly surveys.

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.079
Please fill those out.

00:50:38.079 --> 00:50:46.320
And you will have access to this webinar, to the PowerPoint, and to the pricing documentation

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.039
available.

00:50:48.039 --> 00:50:55.159
And every webinar will come with those three digital assets so that you can review, go

00:50:55.159 --> 00:51:03.639
into areas that you were less comfortable with, and review as you try, and with our assistance,

00:51:03.639 --> 00:51:10.719
drive your company successfully to a higher, faster-growing organization with more profit.

00:51:10.719 --> 00:51:12.480
And with that, thank you.
