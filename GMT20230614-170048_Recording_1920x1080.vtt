WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.919
Well, here it is. A month has already gone by, and here we are at the June version of Tech Edge.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:17.920
For those of you that might be on vacation, lucky you.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:25.920
You're going to miss a great session today, but as always, you'll be able to find it on the Help Center

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.920
and review not only this one, but all the previous Tech Edges.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.920
This month, once again, based on your input, we're going to be talking about pricing.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.920
We're going to be talking about advanced pricing, taking repricing to that next level.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:57.920
For those of you that this is your first Tech Edge, you're going to want to go back to our March Tech Edge.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.920
Once again, you can get it through the Help Center. It gives you a link to the Knowledge Center,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.920
and you'll be able to look at our pricing and repricing primer or first-level webinar

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.920
and maybe get more context or level set for some of the topics we're going to talk about today.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.920
As always, Dr. James is going to be my co-host today, but I think in the coming months,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.920
we're going to start seeing some new people take on this role.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.920
Thank you for coming. Remember, you can always get the video after the session.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.920
James, take it away.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.920
As Jeff mentioned, I encourage you to look at the previous repricing webinar to get your footing

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.920
in terms of the basics, in terms of policy assignment, and overall,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.920
it gives you a lot of the background knowledge you need to engage in this material.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.920
We're going to discuss repricing triggers in a more specific way than last time,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.919
looking at some of the more powerful ones and how they're utilized.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:16.919
Spend some time discussing UPP management, how that's handled in EVP.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:21.919
Look at the price parity option really quickly and how that can be leveraged.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:27.919
Discuss lookup tables once more, reiterating how they should be leveraged

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.919
and what you need, the mindset you should be putting yourself in

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.919
when thinking about how am I going to use them.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.919
Then lastly, we'll end with some Q&A.

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:42.259
Our mission is always to drive growth and profits for you guys through our platform.

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:48.259
The goal of these webinars is to educate you to enable you to, in this case,

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:54.259
offer a more competitive price or capture more margin when repricing.

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.259
Hopefully, one of the... I'm sorry, James.

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:01.259
I think one of the other things that we're learning more and more from some of our clients

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:05.259
is helping them find some cost savings initiatives,

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
finding ways to be more efficient,

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:17.259
finding ways to not always have to add people to accomplish highly repetitious kind of tasks.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:21.259
Increasing margin and profits,

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:29.259
while we often think about sales and revenue growth as the primary way to do that,

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:33.259
many times helping you be more efficient in your operations

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:38.259
can also achieve the same goal of being more profitable.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:42.509
Yep.

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.509
We'll first discuss price event trigger,

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:50.509
what that does and how it can be leveraged, sales velocity trigger,

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.509
a whole buy box policy and what that looks like,

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.509
and then an FBA stock age policy,

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:02.509
exploring how you would leverage the stock age trigger to implement that.

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:06.509
Jumping right in, the first trigger is the price event trigger.

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:11.509
A very simple explanation is when we reach a certain price point,

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:15.509
we take an action and move the item to a new policy.

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:20.509
The price points are the floor target and ceiling calculated by the formulas

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.509
that are associated with policies.

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:29.509
The main thing you can leverage this trigger for is to prevent price stagnation.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.509
You may have a seek loop or you're using a relative amount policy,

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.509
but the behavior you're seeing is items get to the floor and they sit there.

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.509
There's no next action.

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.509
There's no competitive factor.

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.509
I can't lower my price anymore, so I'm sitting at my floor.

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.509
I encourage you to look at any policy you have where items get to the floor

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:02.509
and sit there and add a price event trigger for at floor.

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.509
You could move it into a seek rule that seeks up.

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.509
You can move it into a policy with a higher floor to jump the price up,

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.509
but what you're trying to address is preventing price stagnation

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:19.420
either sitting at the floor or the target or the ceiling.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.420
You can have an initial policy that's using relative amount.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.420
Again, a relative amount is I'm looking at a competitor's price

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.420
and I'm trying to beat it by a certain amount.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.420
Have a price event trigger within a relative amount policy that says,

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.420
if my relative amount gets me to my floor,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.420
I'm going to move it to a policy that instigates new behavior.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.420
Maybe I see, maybe I adjust my formula,

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.420
but again, relative amount competed me down to my floor.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.420
I still didn't win the buy box or I still didn't achieve my sales velocity goals,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.420
so I need to do something besides just sit at my floor

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.420
or try and compete against the other sellers with a relative amount.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.420
I encourage people to jump to the ceiling if they reach the floor

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.420
and what you will find is a lot of other re-pricing engines will chase you.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.420
They chase you down, they just as well might likely chase you up.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:21.420
If I reach my floor, I often encourage clients to move it to a policy

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.420
that spikes the price up, monitor the re-pricing results screen,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.420
see if your competitors follow you,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.420
and then you know you can manipulate your price off the floor

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:37.420
on certain skews when that price event occurs.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.420
James, I think sometimes this is counterintuitive.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.420
If you're not winning at the bottom,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.420
how can jumping to the top help you?

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.420
People will follow you, Amazon will follow you as you go up,

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.420
and then if you're the first one to drop,

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.420
you create a window where you can be very successful.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.389
Exactly.

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.389
The sales velocity trigger is one you may be familiar with,

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:11.389
but it is, in my opinion,

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.389
one of the more powerful triggers we have

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:19.389
in that it gives you an alternative to relative amount.

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:21.389
I keep saying relative amount,

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.389
but the two options you have to compete

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.389
in an e-commerce re-pricing environment are relative amount,

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:29.389
i.e. I reference the price and try and beat it,

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:34.389
or B, I seek my price independent of other players.

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:37.389
What the sales velocity lets you do

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:41.389
is set up a sales velocity-based seek loop,

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:45.389
so what you do is you assess your sales velocity.

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:48.389
If I'm low sales, i.e. I'm below a threshold,

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:50.389
I move to a seek down,

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:54.389
and I lower my price until I hopefully start selling.

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:58.389
If I'm selling a lot, i.e. I'm above a threshold,

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:01.389
I want to see if I can capture a bit more margins

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:04.389
so I move the item to a seek up loop.

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:06.389
This checkbox you see here

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:10.389
will determine how we assess sales velocity.

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:12.389
If I check this box,

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:16.389
I will look at the sales of that skew

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:18.389
across all the listings on that channel.

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:21.389
On Amazon, I might have five or six ASINs

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:23.389
for a single skew.

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:25.389
If I want to look at my sales velocity

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:27.389
from that holistic perspective,

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:29.389
I would check this box.

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:31.389
If I want to just consider the sales velocity

00:08:31.389 --> 00:08:35.389
of the individual listing, I leave it unchecked.

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:38.389
And that can be, that's really determined

00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:41.389
on a kind of a product-by-product basis.

00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:45.389
How many skews does this item have?

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:48.389
Are there reasons those skews would compete differently,

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:51.389
i.e. one's a UOM that doesn't sell as often

00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:56.389
or has got a longer latency?

00:08:56.389 --> 00:09:00.389
Whatever it may be, you have to make a determination.

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:03.389
Is the sales velocity of all these skews important

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:05.389
or are all these listings important

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:08.389
or is it more important to assess it on an individual basis?

00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:11.389
Again, as I mentioned, you want to leverage

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:14.389
the sales velocity trigger into a seek loop

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:18.389
is the most standard in best practice function.

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:20.389
I often have someone use a relative amount

00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:22.389
and the relative amount policy is their seed.

00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:24.389
That's where things start.

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:26.389
And then I have the sales velocity trigger

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:28.389
within that relative amount.

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:30.389
So if the relative amount isn't winning the buy box

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:32.389
or generating the sales,

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:36.389
we change our competitive tactic to seek

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:40.389
and we see if that can generate sales.

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:42.389
Again, don't sleep on the seek up.

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:44.389
People get very focused on the seek down.

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:46.389
What do I do when I seek down?

00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:48.389
Be creative with the seek up.

00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:51.389
You can learn to manipulate other people's pricing

00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:53.389
because their repricers are predictable.

00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:56.389
If I go up, they're going to follow me.

00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:59.389
If I have the buy box and I can seek up a bit

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:02.389
because my latency is a lot better than the other sellers,

00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:05.389
that's another opportunity to use seek up.

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:08.389
I also love the seek up when my competition

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:12.389
is very low on inventory or maybe even stocked out

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:15.389
or if I've picked up a product line

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:18.389
where there's literally no other sellers,

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:21.389
why not find that balance point

00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:24.389
where I can maintain my sales velocity

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:27.389
but also maximize my margin

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:29.389
and profitability on a product?

00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:31.389
Mm-hmm.

00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:34.389
One thing I'll comment about sales velocity is,

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:36.389
and I'm going to emphasize this later

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:38.389
in this PowerPoint presentation,

00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:43.389
is it comes down to catalog segmentation.

00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:46.389
Some clients have huge catalogs of 100,000 items.

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:48.389
Some only have 1,000,

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:50.389
but the better you can slice and dice that to say,

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:53.389
hey, I expect these items to sell really fast,

00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:56.389
so I need to put them in a rule with a sales velocity trigger

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.389
that's appropriate verse.

00:10:58.389 --> 00:11:02.389
I have these huge 1,000 UOM items that sell very slow,

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:06.389
so I need to have them in a separate policy

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:09.389
because their sales velocity is going to be different.

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:11.389
My expectations are going to be different,

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:16.389
so when you're thinking about how to segment my catalog,

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:18.389
a good place to start is,

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:21.389
I expect these things to be high-volume sellers.

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.389
I expect these things to be medium-volume sellers

00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:25.389
and then low-volume sellers,

00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:28.389
and then setting up initial sales velocity policies

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:32.389
that correlate to whether they're fast, slow, or medium sellers.

00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:37.919
Next, we're going to talk about the whole buy box policy.

00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:40.919
This is a combination of two triggers

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:44.919
that you should include in most of your Amazon rules

00:11:44.919 --> 00:11:48.919
if you want to be buy box sensitive.

00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:51.919
The first trigger is a price event trigger,

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:56.919
so you may or may not know when something happens on Amazon,

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:58.919
the buy box changes, the price changes,

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:01.919
the latency changes, an image is added.

00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:06.919
It creates a notification event that we then download and assess,

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:10.919
and we can assess, hey, the notification we're getting

00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:14.919
is indicated that we lost the buy box or we won the buy box,

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:16.919
and then we can instigate a behavior.

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:19.919
If I win the buy box while I'm in a relative amount policy,

00:12:19.919 --> 00:12:23.919
I definitely want to move it to a hold buy box or seek up.

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:27.919
If I'm in a policy that's meant to hold the buy box

00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:30.919
and I lose it, then I probably want to seek down

00:12:30.919 --> 00:12:33.919
or move back to a relative amount.

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.919
The second trigger you're going to want to add

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:38.919
is the buy box status trigger.

00:12:38.919 --> 00:12:41.919
So rather than looking at a price event to see if we win or loss,

00:12:41.919 --> 00:12:45.919
this trigger simply checks who's in the buy box.

00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:48.919
What's powerful about this is the buy box owner

00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:51.919
can be self, FBA, FBM, or Amazon.

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:56.919
So I could have four different buy box status triggers

00:12:56.919 --> 00:12:59.919
that then feed into if I'm competing against Amazon,

00:12:59.919 --> 00:13:01.919
this is how I want to respond.

00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:03.919
If I'm competing against an FBM merchant,

00:13:03.919 --> 00:13:06.919
this is how I want to respond, and then with FBA similarly.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:11.919
So I can decide based on who the seller is, what type of it is,

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:14.919
and then move it to a policy.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.919
In a hold buy box rule, you want to check,

00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:18.919
does the buy box owner equal self?

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:24.919
If it does not equal self, I need to likely instigate a behavior

00:13:24.919 --> 00:13:26.919
because I've lost the buy box.

00:13:26.919 --> 00:13:28.919
But with these two triggers,

00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:33.919
you can find, exit, and enter prices for the buy box.

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:36.919
So again, you're going to the pricing results screen.

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:39.919
When did I enter a hold buy box rule?

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:42.919
That tells me what my price point is that got me the buy box.

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:45.919
When did I move out of a hold buy box policy?

00:13:45.919 --> 00:13:48.919
That'll tell me what my price point is when I lost the buy box.

00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:52.919
And looking at those trends can help you assess, you know,

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:55.919
all right, if I want to consistently hold the buy box,

00:13:55.919 --> 00:14:02.320
I need to keep my ceiling below this.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.320
On a lot of the triggers, you'll see this restore previous price option.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.320
This can make a lot of sense when you're losing the buy box,

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.320
because again, it occurs during a reprice event.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.320
So we may have calculated a new price when we detected the loss,

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.320
that price might have been higher.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.320
So what this does is it says, if I apply this trigger,

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.320
use the previous price versus the one I've just calculated

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.320
that occurred during this event.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.320
And again, if we lost the buy box,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.320
we typically want to lower our price back down when that trigger makes

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.320
that that behavior occur.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:42.629
The delay setting you see here and on a few other triggers,

00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:44.629
it's pretty self-explanatory.

00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:47.629
What it does if I set this to five minutes,

00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:51.629
the item has to be in the policy for five minutes before this trigger

00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:52.629
is applied.

00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:54.629
So in a relative amount policy,

00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:56.629
if I'm checking to see if I won the buy box,

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:59.629
I may delay it for an hour or two because I'm just,

00:14:59.629 --> 00:15:02.629
want the natural, uh,

00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:06.629
competitive behavior to occur for a period of time before I try and,

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:07.629
um,

00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:13.879
instigate a series of behaviors based on winning or losing the buy box.

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:18.539
And again, this is very powerful to include within the seek loops.

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:22.539
I just previously mentioned in that, uh,

00:15:22.539 --> 00:15:24.539
relative amount engages.

00:15:24.539 --> 00:15:26.539
If I win the buy box, I hold it.

00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:27.539
I'm seeking down.

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:29.539
If I lose the buy box,

00:15:29.539 --> 00:15:32.539
I instigate a competitive behavior.

00:15:32.539 --> 00:15:34.539
If I win the buy box,

00:15:34.539 --> 00:15:37.539
I instigate a certain type of behavior.

00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:39.539
But again, um,

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:41.539
when you're setting up your seek loops,

00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:44.539
work with your CSM incorporate the whole buy box policy.

00:15:44.539 --> 00:15:45.539
So that again,

00:15:45.539 --> 00:15:47.539
if you're holding the buy box,

00:15:47.539 --> 00:15:51.539
you're either keeping that margin or trying to increase it.

00:15:51.539 --> 00:15:58.519
The stock age trigger can be used for FBM or FBA.

00:15:58.519 --> 00:16:01.519
Uh, we've seen a lot of success using it for FBA.

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:06.519
We're looking to improve your ability to use it with FBM.

00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:08.519
But at a high level, what it does is it access,

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:14.519
it assesses the stock age of an item and it's low sales threshold.

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:18.519
And then moves the item to a new policy.

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:21.519
If those thresholds are met,

00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:24.519
what I've done with some clients that's been successful as I've set up

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:26.519
stock age tiers.

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:30.519
So I have maybe four or five rules.

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:34.519
Each rule has a lower floor.

00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:37.519
So as stock age increases,

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:40.519
I'll have a stock age trigger that says if it's five days,

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:42.519
and then another in a different policy,

00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:46.519
if it's 10 days, 30 days, uh, 60 days, you know,

00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:49.519
the segments are something you can determine.

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:51.519
But as stock gets older,

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:54.519
I move the item to a policy with the lower floor.

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:58.519
And so what that's enabled people to do is, um,

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:01.519
in a, you know, automated way,

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:05.519
lower my floor price is my stock gets older to try and push it,

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:07.519
try and get rid of it. Um,

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:10.519
so that I can send new stock in, um,

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:15.519
again, each time we move to a new tier, we lower the floor.

00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:19.519
You know, James, you could even go, go ahead.

00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:23.519
I love this idea that occasionally as a stocking merchant,

00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:27.519
uh, um, you're going to just, you're going to have a dog,

00:17:27.519 --> 00:17:29.519
something that's not going to sell.

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:31.519
There's a better product out there,

00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:36.519
but rather than waiting till the very last bullet that James is going to

00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:40.519
talk about, where you just blow it out on a clearance sale,

00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:46.519
where you're going at 30, 40, 50, 60% off.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:50.519
When we see it doesn't, isn't selling early on,

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:55.519
maybe just a week or two, maybe a couple of weeks, whatever that,

00:17:55.519 --> 00:17:59.519
that business rule for your business defines.

00:18:00.519 --> 00:18:07.519
Let's give up five or 10% margin rather than all my margin and take a loss

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:09.519
during the clearance sale.

00:18:10.519 --> 00:18:11.519
Yeah.

00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:14.519
And you know, I'm just thinking creatively,

00:18:14.519 --> 00:18:16.519
I could have that stock age, uh,

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:21.519
tier set of policies that I talked about is a stock age gets older.

00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:24.519
I lower the tier or I lower the floor.

00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:26.519
Excuse me.

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:27.519
Uh,

00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:29.519
you could incorporate a sales velocity trigger within each one of those

00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:30.519
policies.

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:34.519
So I reached here for, and all of a sudden I start selling it.

00:18:34.519 --> 00:18:35.519
I don't want to,

00:18:35.519 --> 00:18:39.519
I don't want to lower my floor now because I've started selling it.

00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:42.519
So that sales velocity trigger applies, uh,

00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:45.519
and moves it to a policy that says, Hey, keep this price point.

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:48.519
The stock's old, but it's selling.

00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:49.519
So again,

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:53.519
the sky's the limit in terms of creativity, um,

00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:55.519
with the EV, EV pricing options.

00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:57.519
So, uh,

00:18:57.519 --> 00:19:00.519
if anyone's interested in incorporating a, uh,

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:04.519
sales velocity trigger within their stock age loops, let me know.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.519
And we can, we can see what we can achieve,

00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:08.519
but I think that would be very powerful because again,

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:11.519
you seek down, you're lowering your floor.

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:13.519
Eventually you'll read a price point where it sells and you can

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.519
identify that with a sales velocity trigger.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.920
Uh, some clients, uh, often deal with UPP or map price.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.920
Uh, for those unaware, that's a minimum advertised price or a universal

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.920
price policy.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.920
It essentially means you can't sell below this point set by the

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.920
manufacturer. Typically.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.920
One thing to know UPP can be stored on individual channel records.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.920
So if I have a supply record, a sales channel record,

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.920
retail record, each one could have a different UPP stored.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.920
Um, we aggregate all the data being sent to us, you know,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.920
sometimes there's discrepancies. Typically.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.920
I always trust the manufacturer over a distributor.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.920
Um, and so I may have a content channel or, uh,

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.920
I know I'm always loading manufacturer data to the etail record.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.920
Um,

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.920
but be aware of where that date is coming from and where it's being

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.920
stored in your system.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.920
If you have multiple UPPs in your system,

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.920
if you go to system, the system module set up in the top banner,

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.920
you'll find UPP config.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.920
We set up a basic logic statement on how it's handled.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.920
If there's multiple UPPs present. So again,

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.920
I can have etail UPP view my source of truth.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.920
And then if it's not there,

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.920
I kind of leverage other data or I can, you know,

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.920
this is the safest bet. I'm always using the highest.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.920
It's a safe bet,

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.920
but it may mean that you're priced too high in some cases.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.920
If you have bad data in the system.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.920
But again,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.920
work with your CSM.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.920
If you're having UPP map management problems,

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.920
there's a number of tools available.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.920
Uh, there's a background checker that doesn't require a reprice event to

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.920
apply.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.920
It simply checks UPP and what the price is and,

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.920
and moves it up.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.920
If it texts it's below.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.920
Um,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.920
how UPP works is it overrides the floor price.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.920
So we calculate a floor price.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.920
If the UPP stored, it overrides it.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.920
So again,

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.920
go ahead, Jeff.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.920
Well, I was finished your top,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.920
but before we move on, I'd like to add something.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.920
Uh,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.920
this reiterating know where that date is coming from,

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.920
know where it's stored and know your options for how you can handle,

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.920
uh, the,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.920
the multiple sources of that information.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.920
I think for a brand clients that are either fairly new in the online

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.920
selling or been there for awhile.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.920
Uh, and not only sell retail or,

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.920
or a dropship for retailers,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.920
um, or have actually authorized resellers.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.920
I think it is so important to have a standardized pricing policy or an,

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.920
uh, have a map policy in place.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.920
It will

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.920
either eliminate or vastly reduce the amount of channel conflict in the

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.920
marketplace.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.920
It will help you clean up the gray market that has been eroding your brand

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.920
value and your brand image by willing to go, uh,

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.920
just keep going lower on the products that you manufacture and sell.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.920
And it'll help create enforce with your approved sellers.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.920
If you have some that,

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.920
Hey, we're going to all play by the same rules now.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.920
And it's really important as a brand to take control,

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.920
control that in the online environment.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.920
That was what I was going to add.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.829
Yeah.

00:22:52.829 --> 00:22:55.829
You can be a pain in the butt if you're being held accountable.

00:22:55.829 --> 00:22:59.829
But again, the tools made available in EDP help make that a lot easier to

00:22:59.829 --> 00:23:00.829
deal with.

00:23:01.829 --> 00:23:05.829
Um, I always encourage you to be proactive rather than reactive, uh,

00:23:05.829 --> 00:23:06.829
with this stuff.

00:23:06.829 --> 00:23:08.829
So having a good relation with your manufacturer,

00:23:08.829 --> 00:23:11.829
so they're giving you that data at a time, uh,

00:23:12.829 --> 00:23:16.829
knowing when you can expect UPP changes, you know,

00:23:16.829 --> 00:23:20.829
automotive space it's yearly, you know, some, some brands are quarterly,

00:23:20.829 --> 00:23:21.829
but, uh,

00:23:21.829 --> 00:23:24.829
knowing when to expect those changes rather than getting the violation

00:23:24.829 --> 00:23:26.829
notice and going and scrambling to fix it.

00:23:27.829 --> 00:23:31.829
Also know that UPP can be a token within a formula and it can be

00:23:31.829 --> 00:23:33.829
leveraged in selection criteria.

00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:37.829
So you can simply say, Hey, if an item has a UPP greater than zero,

00:23:37.829 --> 00:23:40.829
put it in a policy and the price is UPP.

00:23:41.829 --> 00:23:44.829
Uh, I encourage you to be creative with it again,

00:23:45.829 --> 00:23:49.829
just cause you have UPP doesn't mean you can't seek up a bit on

00:23:49.829 --> 00:23:52.829
marketplaces to manipulate the price on your website.

00:23:52.829 --> 00:23:53.829
You're a little more limited.

00:23:54.829 --> 00:24:01.490
Uh, but the next option I wanted to cover,

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:06.490
I've gone over a lot of what you can do with policies and what you

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.490
can do with triggers and you want to segment your catalog.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.490
And this can be a bit overwhelming if you then compound it with,

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:14.490
well,

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:18.490
I have six marketplaces to sign up, set up and reprice and get working

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.490
and flowing well. If you're feeling that way,

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.490
I encourage you to look at the price parity tool,

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.490
pick a channel that's going to be a price driver.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.490
Amazon's a good one cause it's a competitive marketplace.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.490
So there's things influencing the price.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:37.490
Um, but maybe you want your Shopify your own website sales

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:41.490
velocity, being a price driver, whatever you're thinking through that

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:46.490
process, pick on a channel, focus on setting up the

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:51.490
repricing policies and lookup tables for that channel and

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:56.490
leverage the price parity option while, uh, you know,

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.490
you're tackling that channel and then you can tackle channel,

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.490
you know, your next channel and remove price parity.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.490
Um, but again, it lets you tackle one channel,

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.490
set the others to price parity, um,

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.490
and then slowly work on each channel, um,

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.490
versus trying to figure them out all at once.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.490
Very simply price parity has you reference a channel.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.490
So in this case,

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.490
I'm looking at Amazon and I'm going to copy that price.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.490
The mode you'll click that dropdown.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.490
There's 60 different options.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.490
I encourage you just to stick with match lowest delivered.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:34.490
If you have very nuanced price parity objectives,

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:35.490
we can look at those other options,

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.490
but if you're using it for the first time,

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:44.279
use match lowest delivered so you understand the behavior factor

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:47.279
versus Delta, we can adjust the price.

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:50.279
Um, we don't have to copy it one for one.

00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:52.279
So in this case, uh,

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:54.279
let's say this is my eBay channel.

00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:57.279
My eBay channel is going to look at my Amazon price and lower it

00:25:57.279 --> 00:26:00.279
by 10%.

00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:04.279
So this can be a way to, um,

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:07.279
you know, I may want the price parity on my website from Amazon,

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:10.279
but I always want my website to be cheaper.

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:12.279
That's the way you can achieve this.

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:18.009
Lastly, uh, I'm going to end on lookup tables.

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:21.009
I read, I brought this up on the last webinar,

00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:23.009
but when you're looking at lookup tables,

00:26:23.009 --> 00:26:24.009
you want to be,

00:26:24.009 --> 00:26:26.009
this is the question you want to be asking yourself,

00:26:26.009 --> 00:26:28.009
brainstorm with your team.

00:26:28.009 --> 00:26:31.009
What variables impact my margin?

00:26:31.009 --> 00:26:34.009
Bring that list to your CSM and engage with it.

00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:38.009
We can identify which ones are handled by token like shipping cost,

00:26:38.009 --> 00:26:41.009
item cost, uh, static overhead.

00:26:41.009 --> 00:26:42.009
Um,

00:26:42.009 --> 00:26:45.009
but then we can help identify the ones that aren't handled as tokens and

00:26:45.009 --> 00:26:48.009
set them up as lookup tables.

00:26:48.009 --> 00:26:49.009
Uh,

00:26:49.009 --> 00:26:53.009
I wanted to call it overhead tokens because overhead can be a token.

00:26:53.009 --> 00:26:54.009
You go to a location,

00:26:54.009 --> 00:26:57.009
a supplier location on the fulfillment methods tab.

00:26:57.009 --> 00:26:59.009
You can set up per order per item.

00:26:59.009 --> 00:27:02.009
The limitation here is this is a static number.

00:27:02.009 --> 00:27:06.009
If my overhead is dependent on weight or brand or,

00:27:07.009 --> 00:27:08.009
um,

00:27:08.009 --> 00:27:10.539
you know, uh,

00:27:10.539 --> 00:27:12.539
a certain attribute value,

00:27:12.539 --> 00:27:15.539
I can't dynamically adjust this value, but I can,

00:27:15.539 --> 00:27:17.539
if I'm using lookup tables,

00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:21.539
my overhead value can be dynamically adjusted based on item conditions.

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:22.539
So that's something to consider.

00:27:22.539 --> 00:27:26.539
Do I have a flat overhead or do I have a dynamic overhead?

00:27:27.539 --> 00:27:29.539
And so as you're looking at those,

00:27:29.539 --> 00:27:33.539
those things that impact margin working on that list with your CSM,

00:27:33.539 --> 00:27:36.539
you can set up the lookup tables to achieve the ultimate goal.

00:27:36.539 --> 00:27:39.539
Which is to have your price policies drive your price behavior.

00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:43.539
Do I seek up? Do I seek down? Do I compete based on my competitor?

00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:47.539
Do I ignore my competitor? Do I just hold my price price behavior?

00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:50.539
Then lookup tables handle.

00:27:50.539 --> 00:27:53.539
Well, if it's this brand, my margin's different.

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:57.539
If it weighs over a hundred pounds, my margin's different.

00:27:57.539 --> 00:27:58.539
Uh,

00:27:58.539 --> 00:28:00.539
if, uh,

00:28:00.539 --> 00:28:02.539
if it has attribute X,

00:28:02.539 --> 00:28:05.539
then I need this overhead cost added. Um,

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:10.539
anything that's a dynamic variable impacting margin or costs,

00:28:10.539 --> 00:28:12.539
we want to handle this lookup tables.

00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:16.539
So you separate those two aspects of repricing into their, you know,

00:28:16.539 --> 00:28:21.539
allotted swim lanes and you're not running into each other.

00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:25.539
Oh, do I need to adjust my margin on my price policy? No,

00:28:25.539 --> 00:28:29.539
I handle margins in my lookup table. So really being disciplined,

00:28:29.539 --> 00:28:33.539
and thinking about it and what am I, what am I trying to attack?

00:28:33.539 --> 00:28:37.539
How my price behaves or something that's influencing my margin or costs?

00:28:38.539 --> 00:28:39.539
Lastly,

00:28:39.539 --> 00:28:43.539
I've seen a lot of people adopt the lookup tables in the past, uh,

00:28:43.539 --> 00:28:46.539
month since the first webinar. So that's encouraging to see.

00:28:46.539 --> 00:28:50.539
And I've seen some customers take it to the next level and utilize to

00:28:50.539 --> 00:28:53.539
look up tables within a single policy. As far as I'm aware,

00:28:53.539 --> 00:28:55.539
there's no limit. You could.

00:28:55.539 --> 00:28:58.539
Have five lookup tables referenced in a single pricing formula.

00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:00.539
Well, what it's allowing them to do.

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:01.539
Is.

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:04.539
This yellow string of text returns a number. That's their margin.

00:29:04.539 --> 00:29:06.539
This red string of text returns a number.

00:29:06.539 --> 00:29:09.539
That's a additional commission or an overhead.

00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:12.539
And again, this is dynamically adjusted.

00:29:12.539 --> 00:29:15.539
Both of them are dynamically adjusted based on the skew.

00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:18.539
And so they're handling a lot of complexity.

00:29:18.539 --> 00:29:20.539
And I'm going to give you an example.

00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:21.539
And then.

00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:23.539
And then these are the two different modules.

00:29:23.539 --> 00:29:26.539
And the two are dynamically adjusted based on the skew.

00:29:26.539 --> 00:29:29.539
And so they're handling a lot of complexity.

00:29:29.539 --> 00:29:31.539
Um, in a very simplified way.

00:29:31.539 --> 00:29:33.539
With the lookup tables.

00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:36.539
Focused on the margin, you know, this is my formula.

00:29:36.539 --> 00:29:40.539
These things are impacting my margin.

00:29:40.539 --> 00:29:43.539
And then the behavior of what do I do with those ranges is handled by

00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:44.539
the policy.

00:29:44.539 --> 00:29:46.539
Um, so my foot, my.

00:29:46.539 --> 00:29:48.539
I encourage you to at least use the one lookup table.

00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:50.740
really ponder on this question,

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.259
give that list to your CSM and we can help you achieve,

00:29:53.259 --> 00:29:56.400
you know, multiple lookup tables within policy,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:03.240
handling all those variables that impact margin.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.640
I'm gonna reiterate some key points that I have found

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.839
help people manage repricing in EVP

00:30:09.839 --> 00:30:12.920
and in the e-commerce space, have clear objectives.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.619
If your objective is to make more money,

00:30:14.619 --> 00:30:16.720
that's incredibly hard to measure in terms of

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.440
I took an action that made me more money.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.920
I can look at a chart and see that I've done that,

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.119
but you can't really attribute that to an action.

00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:28.240
I encourage you to have clear objectives.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.880
I wanna sell 20% more of Brand X in the next six months,

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.660
or I want to increase my profit margin

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:40.960
across on Amazon by X%.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.480
These clear objectives will help you identify

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.740
more specific, actionable steps.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.920
Versus something as grandiose as just win the buy box more.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.279
Win the buy box more, how?

00:30:55.279 --> 00:30:58.920
By seeking down, by using relative amount,

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:03.920
winning the buy box more isn't always the best objective,

00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:08.279
but it's more specific than just get more sales.

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:10.099
So again, have clear objectives.

00:31:12.569 --> 00:31:15.029
If you're having trouble segmenting your catalog

00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:17.710
by the data that's present,

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.910
you can leverage a re-pricing class attribute

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.210
at a high level.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.509
It's an attribute on the ETail record called re-pricing class.

00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:28.990
And what I do is I have customers getting their feet wet

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:33.069
with re-pricing, go use the bulk update tool

00:31:33.069 --> 00:31:34.430
or the catalog source tool

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.950
to add re-pricing class attribute group one,

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.349
group two, test group three,

00:31:40.349 --> 00:31:43.910
and then leverage that attribute in the selection criteria

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.269
to get items in the specific policies.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:51.190
One of the challenges people face is like,

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:53.349
what selection criteria do I use

00:31:53.349 --> 00:31:55.950
to get things where I need them to be?

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.750
This kind of simplifies that problem.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.109
So you can move forward and then kind of double back

00:32:01.109 --> 00:32:05.630
and go, how can I get this to be more data-driven

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:08.190
versus a grouping that I manually create?

00:32:09.789 --> 00:32:12.230
Again, avoid multiple price policies

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.349
that just change your margin, use the lookup tables.

00:32:15.589 --> 00:32:20.470
The number one violation of this tenant

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:24.269
is people having a policy for cost range.

00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:27.470
Historically, that's what you had to do,

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:28.789
but I would encourage you,

00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:30.589
if that's what your setup looks like,

00:32:30.589 --> 00:32:32.549
one of the first things you're gonna wanna focus on

00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:35.509
is moving all of those into one policy

00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:37.950
and using a lookup table to handle cost range.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:40.990
But you may find that,

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:44.150
oh, I have six policies for these six different brands.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:49.250
That can be one policy and then a lookup table.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.089
Lastly, can't reiterate this enough,

00:32:52.089 --> 00:32:54.569
leverage the repricing results screen.

00:32:54.569 --> 00:32:57.650
You can see when you exited and entered the buy box,

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:58.970
so you know those price ranges.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:03.369
You can see who you're competing against most often.

00:33:03.369 --> 00:33:07.890
You can see which policy and item moved from and to,

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.849
so you can kind of assess the life cycle

00:33:09.849 --> 00:33:11.529
and the behavior of your setup.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:16.369
But simply looking at the SKU

00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:18.250
and what price it's calculating

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:20.930
won't tell you the entire journey it's gone through.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.890
Look at the repricing results screen,

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.250
get familiar with that.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.490
And I've looked at it enough

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:31.809
and helped enough clients that I can look at that.

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:33.809
I can look at a SKU, I can look at several SKUs,

00:33:33.809 --> 00:33:36.369
and I can see the journey it's taking

00:33:36.369 --> 00:33:40.250
that just takes time and exposure using the screen.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.609
So I encourage you to, every time you wanna go,

00:33:43.609 --> 00:33:46.690
hey, what's going on with repricing, start there,

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:48.769
look up a SKU and get familiar

00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:52.980
with what that information's telling you.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:57.339
I think also remember that while pricing is important

00:33:57.339 --> 00:34:00.660
for the reseller community to win the buy box,

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:05.299
it is not the only variable in the Amazon algorithm.

00:34:05.299 --> 00:34:07.940
Latency is also very important.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.820
How quickly can you get the product to somebody?

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.619
Somebody that's FBA and is gonna get it there in a day

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:16.739
or two is going to always beat somebody

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:18.539
at five or six days,

00:34:18.539 --> 00:34:21.340
even if they're selling at a higher price.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.500
Your ODR, your seller ranking is gonna make a difference.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.139
So there's other factors in your business

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:32.900
you need to focus on to have these repricing strategies

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.820
have the greatest impact.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.300
I think for any of our clients

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:41.300
that have some fantastic high velocity products

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.860
and they're not at FBA,

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.980
you might wanna think about that.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.820
So-

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.179
Nick, if you can to reiterate,

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:56.300
this webinar went a bit more granular than the previous one,

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.019
but they're all purposed around getting you

00:35:00.019 --> 00:35:03.500
some background knowledge so that you can start thinking

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.820
and then in turn engage with your CSM.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:09.230
Again, going back,

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.989
what variables impact your margin?

00:35:10.989 --> 00:35:14.269
If you come to your CSM with a list of things

00:35:14.269 --> 00:35:16.469
that you've identified impacting your margin,

00:35:16.469 --> 00:35:18.829
they're gonna be much better enabled

00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:21.070
to help you set up lookup tables.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.230
So these are, I'm encouraging you,

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.550
I'm trying to get you to think

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.989
so that when you meet with your CSM,

00:35:27.989 --> 00:35:30.269
they can help you leverage all that content

00:35:30.269 --> 00:35:34.170
you've generated from that brainstorming.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.530
A few questions here, James.

00:35:40.489 --> 00:35:45.489
Are there triggers for eBay and Walmart or just Amazon?

00:35:48.329 --> 00:35:51.050
Triggers and controllers work on all channels.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.570
Some channels have triggers that others don't.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:58.570
For example, Amazon price event triggers only on Amazon,

00:35:59.409 --> 00:36:03.050
but sales velocity, price events, timers,

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.969
those will work across all channels.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.050
Okay.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.130
Seek up, seek down, hold price will also work on all channels.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.570
Also, if some of you have been holding your questions,

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.730
get them in here before I get done.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.210
How often can I seek up and down?

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:20.969
That's a great question.

00:36:20.969 --> 00:36:24.769
It's gonna really be dependent on a number of variables

00:36:24.769 --> 00:36:26.210
that would have to be assessed,

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:27.889
such as catalog size,

00:36:28.889 --> 00:36:35.739
the number of notifications we're dealing with from Amazon,

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.900
the banding on certain channels.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.739
But at a high level, I typically seek every,

00:36:45.619 --> 00:36:48.780
the quickest I try and seek is every 15 minutes.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.219
You're not likely going to achieve seeking every minute

00:36:53.219 --> 00:36:54.340
without very,

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:59.340
without setup that isolates and handles that very specifically.

00:37:01.579 --> 00:37:04.739
And at that point, there's probably a better solution

00:37:04.739 --> 00:37:08.739
than getting the repricing engine

00:37:08.739 --> 00:37:10.860
to just look at that one skew.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.380
You could achieve it in a different way.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.579
But it's a good question.

00:37:14.579 --> 00:37:17.699
It would have to be determined with your CSM on a call,

00:37:17.699 --> 00:37:18.539
but-

00:37:19.539 --> 00:37:23.179
I would imagine also depends on catalog size.

00:37:23.179 --> 00:37:25.260
Yeah, I mean, that's gonna be the biggest variable

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.420
because how long does it take us to get to your catalog?

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.260
How many items are getting prioritized for repricing?

00:37:33.179 --> 00:37:35.300
But, you know, the quickest increments

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.940
I typically recommend are between 15 and 30 minutes.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.780
Okay.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.460
Can I schedule policies?

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:50.760
Maybe I wanna raise my price in the evenings.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.079
Yeah, so there's an indirect way to achieve that

00:37:54.159 --> 00:37:56.519
with shipping policies.

00:37:56.519 --> 00:37:58.920
You can have your selection criteria

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.639
within your repricing policies,

00:38:00.639 --> 00:38:04.119
look at what shipping policy and items assigned to.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.559
And shipping policies can be scheduled.

00:38:07.559 --> 00:38:12.239
So I can have an item scheduled to move to a shipping policy.

00:38:12.239 --> 00:38:15.519
I can have a very high priority rule

00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:20.079
that says items in this shipping policy get assigned to it.

00:38:20.079 --> 00:38:23.039
And then it would reprice with that rule

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.559
that the pricing policy schedule would expire

00:38:27.559 --> 00:38:29.119
and I assume we would move it back.

00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:30.800
And at that point,

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.480
the repricing policy assigned to it would change.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.480
So you can achieve time scheduled repricing

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.599
with the usage of scheduling shipping policy assignment.

00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:46.440
Okay.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.800
Well, and here's one very similar to the statement

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.119
I made just a few minutes ago.

00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:56.119
Jen, if I'm selling an FBA and my competition is FBM,

00:38:57.119 --> 00:39:01.840
can I raise my price or seek up with my price

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.559
and then wait till I lose the buy box

00:39:04.559 --> 00:39:09.199
and then steal it right back?

00:39:09.199 --> 00:39:13.360
So you would have, from understanding correctly,

00:39:14.559 --> 00:39:19.039
you're in the buy box and the person competing is FBM?

00:39:19.039 --> 00:39:21.360
Correct, and I'm FBA.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.599
I have the prime batch.

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:27.199
So I could, you would have a policy

00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:31.800
that detects you in the buy box, moves you to a seek up.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.360
And that seek up, you have a trigger that's detecting

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.599
if you lose the buy box.

00:39:35.599 --> 00:39:38.000
And if you lose, you move to a seek down

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.079
or a relative amount.

00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:46.119
You could also have a, say it's in a price policy.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.920
You could have a buy box status trigger

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.559
that says if buy box owner is FBA,

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.880
I wanna compete in a certain way

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.400
that gets your price going back up.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.440
But yeah, you could achieve that.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.159
Well, I only have a few minutes left.

00:40:06.159 --> 00:40:08.960
What's the best way to segment my catalog?

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.760
Great question.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.599
I think,

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.840
just to give some examples in the automotive space brand,

00:40:20.199 --> 00:40:24.239
manufacturer, huge drivers in the home goods space,

00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:26.840
it's more about what type of product it is.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.039
I want all my curtains.

00:40:28.039 --> 00:40:30.079
I want all my bathroom accessories.

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:34.639
I want all my space rugs.

00:40:34.639 --> 00:40:41.559
So there isn't a one size fits all answer,

00:40:44.639 --> 00:40:47.599
but I would encourage you looking at brands

00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:49.800
is a segmentation factor.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.320
Cost is obviously an obvious one,

00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:57.559
but it's gonna be dependent on your space

00:40:57.559 --> 00:41:00.239
and industry knowledge, really.

00:41:00.239 --> 00:41:02.280
For example, I deal with a lot of customers

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.519
that sell light bulbs.

00:41:06.199 --> 00:41:07.480
They're gonna know a lot.

00:41:08.679 --> 00:41:11.639
They're gonna know better how to segment that than I would.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.760
Do they have industrial light bulbs

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.539
and then commercial light bulbs?

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.730
I would engage with your CSM

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.610
so they can provide some input,

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.210
but it's really gonna be your industry knowledge

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:30.610
and your industry segment that's gonna drive that.

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:33.130
But again, two examples, automotive space,

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.090
it's really brand driving it.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:37.929
And then in home goods, it's really the type of product.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.010
Okay, here's a quick one.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:46.949
Does UPP override MAP for re-pricing?

00:41:46.949 --> 00:41:47.949
Great question.

00:41:47.949 --> 00:41:54.230
MAP is actually more of just a stored data point in EVP.

00:41:55.969 --> 00:41:58.590
If you want MAP to be leveraged

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:02.829
as a price influencing mechanism stored as UPP.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.300
Oh, that's pretty simple.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:12.300
The terms are synonymously used out in the marketplaces.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:17.940
So what we chose to do is they serve the same function.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.420
So again, MAP is just stored in EVP.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.739
You can reference it, you can see it.

00:42:22.739 --> 00:42:26.059
UPP is the one that's gonna drive price behavior,

00:42:26.059 --> 00:42:28.440
prevent you from selling below that.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.440
So if you're hyper aware or wanna be vigilant on UPP slash MAP,

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.219
always store it as a UPP.

00:42:37.219 --> 00:42:38.059
Okay.

00:42:38.059 --> 00:42:41.000
MAP has no influence on pricing.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.059
I don't think we're gonna get to all of them today.

00:42:43.059 --> 00:42:45.000
So any of them that I don't get to,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.739
just email your CSM and or schedule a meeting

00:42:49.739 --> 00:42:51.139
and bear with me, James,

00:42:51.139 --> 00:42:55.579
this one is about a small paragraph.

00:42:55.579 --> 00:43:00.579
Is it possible to re-price an ASIN on Amazon

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:06.039
relative to the price of a completely different ASIN?

00:43:06.039 --> 00:43:09.900
We have a product that we are the only seller.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.780
So we always have the buy box

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:16.880
but we compete against a different ASIN.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.840
We'd like to set our re-pricing to compete against

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.840
the buy box price of a different ASIN that we don't sell.

00:43:26.039 --> 00:43:27.199
Is that possible?

00:43:27.199 --> 00:43:32.650
So it's almost like two brands competing with each other.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:35.010
Yeah, what I'm hearing is you wanna do

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:37.989
a skew level price parity.

00:43:40.449 --> 00:43:43.349
I'm not aware of a way to achieve that today

00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:46.090
but that would be an excellent feature request to explore.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.510
What you're saying is I have two ASINs

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:52.130
and I want this one to be the price driver for both

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.050
because I'm alone on one of them.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.210
Yeah, that's a very interesting scenario.

00:44:02.519 --> 00:44:07.519
Just thinking through, yeah, I don't know

00:44:09.719 --> 00:44:11.000
if that could be achieved today

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.400
but it would be something worth exploring

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.920
as a price parity enhancement.

00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:20.920
Yeah, and we had some comments

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.860
from their other CSMs that are on the call,

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.480
a great product feature request.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.679
So whoever brought that up,

00:44:29.679 --> 00:44:34.519
sit with your CSM, figure out how to more fully define that

00:44:34.519 --> 00:44:37.059
and we'll have Dev take a look at that.

00:44:39.239 --> 00:44:41.280
All those other questions that you had out there,

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.239
I'm sorry, we're coming up on our time

00:44:44.239 --> 00:44:47.440
and we wanna be respectful of your time.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:53.280
I do wanna remind you, you can move to the next slide.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.400
Our next session is gonna be in July.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.079
It is gonna be July 12th,

00:45:01.079 --> 00:45:05.239
a month from the second Wednesday of the month.

00:45:05.239 --> 00:45:08.500
We will be sending out a survey again,

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:13.420
asking you for your input on three different topics

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.699
that we can talk about.

00:45:15.699 --> 00:45:17.539
Hopefully you'll pick a topic

00:45:17.539 --> 00:45:20.559
that we can give James a month off.

00:45:22.139 --> 00:45:26.219
But I love doing these, we want you to attend.

00:45:26.219 --> 00:45:30.019
Remember, this will be available in 24 to 48 hours

00:45:30.019 --> 00:45:34.460
after the session is over in the Help Center,

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:36.219
in the Knowledge Center.

00:45:36.219 --> 00:45:39.099
If you have any other questions

00:45:39.099 --> 00:45:42.940
or wanna talk about this in more in depth,

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.440
please work with your CSM.

00:45:46.659 --> 00:45:50.000
And I also wanna talk about some new offers coming up.

00:45:51.179 --> 00:45:55.179
Several of you have already initiated something.

00:45:55.179 --> 00:45:59.659
We're trying to take questions

00:45:59.659 --> 00:46:03.900
and similar kind of thoughts from multiple clients

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:08.900
and develop packages that are more optimally priced

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.539
to make it easier for you to move forward.

00:46:11.539 --> 00:46:16.539
There's less ambiguity and there's less unknowns.

00:46:17.539 --> 00:46:18.820
You know what you're getting.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.139
There's a known price

00:46:20.139 --> 00:46:23.159
and you know how quickly you can expect to see results.

00:46:23.159 --> 00:46:26.460
One of them that many of you are familiar with

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.940
is the eBay Accelerate Program.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.559
We're taking this approach

00:46:31.559 --> 00:46:34.260
from working with a couple other merchants

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.139
that do very well on eBay

00:46:37.139 --> 00:46:41.099
and have very successful eBay programs.

00:46:41.099 --> 00:46:45.380
And finding out those best practices and best approaches

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:49.340
to keep in their eBay program fresh and aligned

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.059
with their growth objectives.

00:46:52.139 --> 00:46:55.300
And the major things that we've pulled out about of that

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.519
are things that like delisting and relisting

00:46:58.519 --> 00:47:00.659
can have a major impact.

00:47:00.659 --> 00:47:03.800
Understanding what it would take to get your account

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.260
into the eBay Top Seller Program

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:11.739
and trying to round out your user profile

00:47:11.739 --> 00:47:14.300
along with re-pricing optimizations.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.900
And one of these other merchants saw a 10% increase

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.260
and it's been for several months now

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.900
on their eBay program, monthly sales.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.780
Now, let's be honest,

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.940
eBay is not necessarily a retirement account for most of you

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.940
but 10% is 10%, multiply it times 12, it's a real number.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:42.400
A number of you already reviewing your re-pricing goals

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.980
with your CSM to be commended.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:50.739
And those of you that have not reviewed your re-pricing goals

00:47:50.739 --> 00:47:53.039
and looked at all your different policies

00:47:53.039 --> 00:47:56.940
in the last 12 to 18 months, it's time.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:01.059
Contact your CSM so we can take a quick review.

00:48:01.059 --> 00:48:04.019
But once again, we wanna be packaging this up

00:48:04.019 --> 00:48:06.460
into a simple offering.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:12.300
We're working on actually doing several predefined policies

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.579
that can be added to your environment

00:48:15.579 --> 00:48:20.179
and then tweet to meet your exact objectives.

00:48:20.179 --> 00:48:23.079
So you'll be seeing some very,

00:48:25.019 --> 00:48:27.139
the basics of any business

00:48:27.139 --> 00:48:31.019
will be developed by some of our people.

00:48:31.019 --> 00:48:35.219
And once again, we're seeing some people increase sales

00:48:35.219 --> 00:48:40.039
15 to 25% by just taking a fresh new look

00:48:40.039 --> 00:48:44.219
at how they're doing their pricing policies

00:48:44.219 --> 00:48:46.019
and it's very doable.

00:48:46.019 --> 00:48:47.780
And then stay tuned,

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.940
while we initiated the eBay Accelerate Program

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.380
around 30, 45 days ago,

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:58.780
we're starting to look at other marketplaces and saying,

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:02.260
how can we make our community more successful

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.900
on that marketplace?

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.900
And we'll work with one or two people

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.940
to figure out the best way to approach that.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:13.079
Then we'll take those best practices to you, the community

00:49:13.079 --> 00:49:16.099
and offer a very affordable program.

00:49:16.099 --> 00:49:20.539
And I'm hearing rumblings, it's gonna be Walmart

00:49:20.539 --> 00:49:22.380
and we'll share that with you.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:25.280
And if that's something you wanna engage us on

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.300
to grow your Walmart business, we'd be happy to do so.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.820
Thank you for attending.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.059
I really enjoy doing this

00:49:33.059 --> 00:49:36.059
because James has to do all the work.

00:49:36.059 --> 00:49:38.300
I just get to do introductions

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:44.340
and I hope that you get some value each time we do this.

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.780
So thank you again.

00:49:46.699 --> 00:49:48.340
Have a great summer.

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.500
We'll see you in July.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.900
And if you have any further questions, once again,

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.380
we say it all the time,

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:59.460
just give James or Jason or someone at eBay a call.

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.480
We're gonna try and help you out.

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.320
Thank you.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.460
Thank you.
